# Debugging variables to match Yaw's functionality (2025-09-07 15:33Z)

_**User**_

We have easing working properly with Yaw — on startup, at mouse release, on bounce.  However none of the other variables — pitch, zoom, pan etc. work at all.  The task is simply to compare how all the others work as compared to Yaw, and make the others work exactly as Yaw does (each independently).  In other words, you are debugging, but only in terms of comparing — we already know the core logic works perfectly, because Yaw works perfectly.  There error is *only* in properly mirroring Yaw's structure to the other variables.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging the code**

I need to debug the code in the project based on the user's feedback. They mentioned that yaw easing works correctly but variations like pitch, zoom, and pan do not. The task is to compare these variables with yaw and ensure they function the same way. I'll look into `js/app-module.js` for relevant easing functions and state updates. It involves creating a to-do list for multi-step tasks like reading the implementation, auditing the other functions, and testing.
**Planning code exploration**

I see that the codebase is small enough to read `app-module.js` directly. However, the guidelines suggest using the codebase_search for exploration. Reading all 2586 lines might be overwhelming, so I can also use grep to search for yaw, pitch, zoom, and pan occurrences, which helps in understanding the structure quickly. I should create a to-do list that includes reviewing yaw easing, comparing the other variables, fixing missing pieces, and cleaning up any code duplication. Before running any tool calls, I need to provide a status update too.
**Streamlining todo items**

I should keep the to-do list concise, aiming for about 4 items. It’ll help me focus better. Then, I can perform parallel grep searches in `app-module.js` for keywords related to easing — things like "yaw," "pitch," "roll," "zoom," "pan," and variations like "easing" or "bounce." I’ll use functions.grep with output files from the workspace, searching just within this file to minimize noise. Reading relevant lines after the grep might be more efficient, but I can also read the entire 2586 lines if necessary. Comparing yaw easing to the others is crucial.
**Formulating hypotheses**

I have some hypotheses about how the event handlers work: delta yaw is calculated from horizontal mouse movement, pitch from vertical, zoom from the wheel, and pan from right-click or shift-drag. However, it seems the easing engine may only use yaw's delta and its smoothing.

For instance, I see a potential pattern where `currentYaw` might get updated through `lerp(currentYaw, targetYaw, easingAmount)`, while others may use direct assignments or not be included in updates. I’ll need to scan the module to locate yaw easing implementation and compare it to the others. I'll set up my grep searches accordingly.</details></think>

---

I'll scan `js/app-module.js` to locate the Yaw easing implementation and compare it against Pitch, Zoom, and Pan to identify inconsistencies. Then I'll fix the non-working ones to mirror Yaw's structure.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Map Yaw easing flow: state, targets, update loop, triggers
- [ ] Audit Pitch, Zoom, Pan flows and diff them against Yaw
- [ ] Mirror Yaw logic for Pitch, Zoom, Pan (startup, release, bounce)
- [ ] Smoke-test interactions and adjust constants if needed

---

I'll open the relevant files to locate the Yaw easing implementation and compare to Pitch, Zoom, Pan. Then I'll diff and plan edits.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring code elements**

I need to process some code by reading it in chunks using an offset and limit. First, I’ll focus on discovering the yaw handling code and related variables like yaw, pitch, pan, and zoom. I can use functions like grep to quickly search for these patterns, although the main tool for exploration is codebase_search. For precise symbol searches, grep is still a good fit. I’ll search for "yaw" in app-module.js and keep an eye out for easing functions as well.
**Running parallel searches**

I’m planning to run parallel grep searches for yaw, pitch, pan, zoom, and patterns related to easing like "ease" and "lerp" in app-module.js. I might look at CSS and other files, but the main logic seems to be in app-module.js. I’ll be sure to include some status updates before making tool calls to keep everything on track. I’ll use functions.grep with various patterns while respecting output volume, especially focusing on different forms like "Yaw" or "yawSpeed." Let's call multi_tool_use.parallel for a thorough search!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the code to locate where Yaw is implemented and how easing is applied, then compare Pitch, Zoom, and Pan to find structural mismatches. Running searches in parallel for relevant symbols.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I'm noticing some contradictions in the code related to yaw smoothing. They mention easing working properly with yaw, but they've set alphaYaw to 1 which disables easing. It seems they opted for yaw acceleration management instead. I need to examine the states for pitch, pan, and zoom. I found some references in the grep results showing pitch states, but I wonder if there are triggers for transitioning pitch states. It looks like yaw uses a toggle, but I'm not sure about pitch.
I'm trying to figure out the yaw settings in the code. The yaw toggles with the 'Y' key, and I'm wondering if other controls should be enabled by default too. I've found that the default yaw speed is set to 0 in the code, but the UI shows a default of 6. It seems like there might be conflicts between the UI and the code defaults. The user mentioned that other variables like pitch and zoom aren't functioning at all, which is puzzling because they should be active, right?
I'm considering why the panX, panY, and zoom defaults might be set to 0 and whether they're updated based on GUI input. It seems like they only move when you adjust the sliders. The 'Auto-spin' section mentions a default pan x speed of 8, while the UI shows slightly different initial values. It looks like the code may not be correctly reading those values; instead, it's using default constants for pan speeds, but I need to check what DEFAULT_PAN_SPEED_X and related constants are defined as. Also, yaw speed seems to work despite it being set to 0 initially.
I need to look into how the UI elements and state are set up when the application loads. First, I'll search for 'state = {' to pinpoint the initial values and how they map. It seems important to check how defaults are applied, so I’ll also look for instances of 'apply defaults' using grep. Understanding how these states are initialized could clarify how everything interacts and functions together in the code. Let's see what I can find!</details></think>

---

I'll inspect key sections of `app-module.js`: constants, spin initialization, FSM logic in the update loop, and UI-state mapping, in parallel. Then I'll compare Yaw FSM structure with Pitch/Pan/Zoom and identify mismatches.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing user query on easing variables**

I’m looking at the user's query, which mentions that easing is working with Yaw on startup, mouse release, and bounce—yet other variables like pitch, zoom, and pan aren’t functioning. The task is to compare these variables to Yaw and ensure they operate the same way. It sounds like I’ll need to debug by mirroring the structure of Yaw's FSM and easing onto pitch, pan, and zoom. The core logic for Yaw is confirmed to work well, so it's just about replicating that success for the others.
**Debugging easing implementations for pitch, pan, and zoom**

I'm analyzing the user's mention of partial implementations for pitch, pan, and zoom. The necessary state variables like pitchState, panXState, and zoomState exist, but it seems there are issues, particularly in starting and resuming from zero. The current velocities for pitch, pan, and zoom might not be transitioning correctly, and there’s also a lack of code to initiate them from a stopped state. It looks like the events currently only manage yaw, so I'll need to duplicate that logic across the other variables to ensure consistency.
**Identifying issues in pitch, pan, and zoom**

It looks like I need to address the tasks related to starting the pitch, pan, and zoom functionality. Currently, only yaw is set to accelerate on startup. I’ll need to implement similar logic for pitch, pan, and zoom. Their default speeds seem to be zero, even though pitch has a non-zero value, which complicates things since they aren't functioning at all. Additionally, the code requires that I set the pitchState correctly at startup to facilitate movement, as it’s currently stuck in a state that prevents any motion.
**Addressing pitch state logic**

I see that there's an early pitch reversal logic that only activates when the pitch state changes to 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel'. However, the issue is that it never actually reaches that state. This means the logic isn't being utilized effectively. I need to investigate why the pitch state isn’t transitioning properly. If the system can’t move past its initial state, the functionality will be impaired, and I might need to implement some conditions to trigger that transition.
**Planning fixes for pitch state logic**

To resolve the issue, I’ll mirror the yaw starting logic so that the pitchState is set from zero to either "IncreaseVelToSteadyState" or directly to 'SteadyStateVel'. I need to ensure that all controls—pitch, pan, and zoom—are adjusted similarly to yaw during the 'end' resume event. This involves setting their states to 'SteadyStateZero' and starting acceleration if speeds are above zero. There are some implementations for pitch, but it seems the transitions and integrations aren’t fully set up, especially for 'ePitch_ReverseDirection.' I should look deeper into the code to find occurrences of 'ePitch_' to better understand the integration.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing easing for controls**

I see we need to make sure yaw easing works while others don’t. The user wants us to compare the other controls to yaw and ensure they function similarly, so I’ll have to implement a finite state machine (FSM) for pitch, pan x/y, and zoom. We should include features like startup acceleration and mouse release handling. Though, I noticed there are already some states and early reversal logic, but they might not have the full FSM toggles or startup initialization like yaw does.
**Investigating control speeds**

I’m figuring out that some controls may not be displayed or could default to zero speeds. For instance, the default constants show zero speeds for pan and zoom, but pitch has a speed of 20 degrees. Yaw has a speed of zero, which seems contradictory since the user says yaw easing works. I wonder if this is because the UI is overriding the initial values. I need to check the UI initialization code to see what values are being set based on user input. The user's claim about yaw’s functionality is interesting, especially compared to pitch, zoom, and pan.
**Analyzing yaw FSM implementation**

I'm diving into the code, and it looks like yaw has a complete finite state machine (FSM) with transitions for starting and resuming, controlled by the 'y' key. In contrast, other controls have only partial FSMs, possibly getting stuck in their steady state. While "pitchDesiredRunning" is set to true, I don't see it influencing states, just an early reversal in steady-state. Unlike yaw, there's no acceleration logic at the start or a decrease to zero when not running. So, yaw really stands out with its thorough FSM structure and proper initialization.
**Addressing pitch, pan, and zoom states**

I'm looking into pitch, pan, and zoom, and it seems there are states, but only 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' is used. Without 'increase' or 'decrease' states, pitch starts at zero. I suspect that "stepSpin" sets current pitch velocity to zero since 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel' isn't reached at startup. The same goes for panX and panY, which also begin at 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero,' leading to no movement. The bug is that these variables lack initial transitions to steady at startup. I think I need to mirror yaw’s triggers for acceleration and desired running toggles.
**Enhancing control functionalities**

I need to implement toggles and keyboard controls for pitch, pan, and zoom to work independently like yaw does. Each variable should have its own FSM with states for start, steady, stop, and reverse, along with proper acceleration logic at startup and on mouse release. I see there's already some reversal code in place, but it's missing transition accelerations. I’ll adapt yaw's structure for the others and ensure desired running toggles drive state transitions. So in the initialization, I must set 'desiredRunning' for each dimension, and implement smooth transitions similar to yaw. Finally, I need to ensure the UI elements accurately reflect this setup and control speeds effectively.
**Implementing control logic modifications**

I need to set up the UI for pitch, pan, and zoom to function similarly to yaw. The setup should include independent FSMs and flags like 'pitchDesiredRunning' without needing specific UI toggles for now since defaults can remain true. I'll add the necessary restart logic for pitch, pan, and zoom in the 'setupControls' section. Moreover, I'll introduce 'pitchStartSign' and similar properties for other dimensions to track signs for deceleration. This will help ensure seamless integration and clarity, following the required structure while maintaining clarity and avoiding redundancy.
**Updating control logic for integration**

I need to enhance the control logic for pitch, pan, and zoom, ensuring they align with yaw's structure. The 'StartSign' is only important for detecting transitions to zero during deceleration. I'll define the requested states based on the 'desiredRunning' flags and add integration for 'IncreaseVel' and 'DecreaseVelToZero' within a switch-case structure.

Additionally, I must implement integration for pitch's 'ReverseDirection' and make sure acceleration is consistent with yaw. This involves adding new properties for start signs and ensuring the UI handles only necessary toggles.
**Refining initialization and integration logic**

In the 'init', I could set 'pitchDesiredRunning' and others earlier, but since they default to true, it may not be necessary. We can focus on handling them in 'stepSpin', which checks for 'desiredRunning'. I'll add a pitch finite state machine (FSM) for integration, resembling yaw's structure. Each state requires specific logic for transitioning velocity. Also, I'll need to change the declaration of 'targetPitchVel' to 'let' for updates, similar to yaw, and integrate similar logic for pan and zoom to maintain consistency.
**Refining velocity integration logic**

I’m looking at how 'curPanXVel' uses 'targetPanXVel' for state conditions. For 'SteadyStateZero', we don't need to change 'targetPanXVel' because 'curVel' would naturally hit zero. I realize that we can keep 'const targetPitchVel' unchanged. For the pan 'Increase/Decrease' states, I'll extend integration in the 'Integrate pan' block, handling both 'SteadyStateZero' and 'motion' states. I’ll also add 'Pitch FSM', 'Pan FSM', and 'Zoom FSM' states after the yaw 'switch-case', ensuring to keep consistent indentation as I insert the new logic.
**Enhancing integration logic**

I’m addressing the absence of a 'switch-case' for pitch by planning to add it after the yaw 'switch-case'. For pan and zoom, similar state management will be implemented. The existing 'Integrate pan' only accounts for 'ReverseDirection', so I’ll expand it to include both 'Increase' and 'Decrease' states. For zoom, I’ll also integrate those states, ensuring the distance updates during deceleration. Lastly, I need to ensure consistent code indentation and prepare patches for implementing all these changes effectively.
**Applying patches for pan and zoom**

For panY, I’m adding the necessary properties: setting 'panYState' to 'ePanY_SteadyStateZero', alongside initializing 'panYTransitionVel', 'panYA', and 'panYDesiredRunning'. I’ll also include 'panYStartSign: 0' after 'panYA'.  

Then, for zoom, I'll set 'zoomState' to 'eZoom_SteadyStateZero', initializing 'zoomTransitionVel', 'zoomA', and 'zoomDesiredRunning'. I'll add 'zoomStartSign: 0' immediately after 'zoomA'. Now, I'm ready to apply these updates.</details></think>

---

I’m going to update the easing FSM to mirror Yaw for Pitch, Pan X/Y, and Zoom: add missing startSign fields, add FSM transitions (increase/decrease to steady/zero), integrate reverse direction for pitch, and trigger re-acceleration on mouse release for all. Then I’ll run a quick lint check.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing code behavior**

The code has early reversal for pitch, pan, and zoom, where it enters a ReverseDirection state and decelerates to zero before accelerating. However, I realize it might lack transitions that start from zero to steady and handle desired running toggles like yaw. Plus, I need to consider the smoothing alpha forcing aspect. I think it’s a good idea to systematically compare yaw to the other transitions to better understand their differences.
**Reviewing yaw logic in stepSpin**

I’m analyzing the yaw logic within the stepSpin function. First, it computes alpha using alphaYaw = 1 and establishes a default yaw target velocity with yawDirection. The yaw finite state machine toggles based on the key ‘Y’ and checks initial conditions. Depending on the desired state, it sets velocities for easing transitions. It seems that there are specific setups for increasing and decreasing velocity states, and interestingly, there isn’t similar logic for pitch, pan, or zoom, which I need to consider.
**Examining stepSpin functionalities**

In the stepSpin function, I see that pitch, pan, and zoom have early reversal mechanics with their own states and acceleration variables. However, I notice there's no management for variables like 'pitchDesiredRunning' or 'panXDesiredRunning,' even though these terms exist but aren't utilized. Unlike yaw, pitch, pan, and zoom lack states for increasing or decreasing velocity. Additionally, it seems unclear how the initial state transitions to 'SteadyStateVel,' especially without a clear condition for reaching it from the reverse state, which I need to clarify.
**Addressing pitch functionality issues**

I’m realizing that the pitch might stay in 'SteadyStateZero' indefinitely, meaning the targetPitchVel would only be used if the state is 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel'; otherwise, it defaults to pitchTransitionVel, which starts at 0. This implies curPitchVel would remain 0 without a transition changing the state to 'SteadyStateVel'. The early reversal check won’t trigger if it’s in 'SteadyStateZero', so pitch never starts. I really need to add 'DesiredRunning' toggles for pitch, pan, and zoom, similar to yaw, to trigger transitions effectively!
**Implementing pitch, pan, and zoom functionality**

The goal is to align pitch, pan, and zoom functionality to work independently like yaw does. I think I should implement pitch’s finite state machine similar to yaw's, without tying them together. I wonder if key toggles, such as 'P' or 'W', are necessary since the requirements focus on actions at startup, mouse release, and bouncing. Adding 'DesiredRunning' flags might be essential for triggering acceleration to steady states. It looks like I need to ensure that pitch, pan, and zoom also utilize those states and their respective transitions effectively.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Following developer instructions**

I need to follow the developer instructions closely. The user provided a task about easing working with Yaw and other variables like pitch, zoom, and pan that aren’t functioning properly. The main goal is to debug and compare these variables to Yaw, which is working well. It's clear we need to mirror Yaw's structure for the other variables. I’ll review the files and explore the code as directed without asking the user for additional information.
**Implementing pitch and pan FSM**

I started by adding startSign fields to the structure of pitch, pan, and zoom, but I need to fully implement a yaw-like finite state machine (FSM) for these variables. This includes ensuring they have desired running toggles on animation start and mouse release to accelerate from zero to a steady speed. 

Each state for pitch, panX, panY, and zoom needs to mirror yaw's states and transitions, including handling the pitchDesiredRunning variable, which I noticed isn't being utilized effectively.
**Addressing pan and zoom logic**

For pan and zoom, I see there are desiredRunning booleans, but they lack the necessary toggles or triggers. I need to replicate yaw's start/resume logic across all these variables. In the update loop, I noticed we have early reversal defined for pan, pitch, and zoom, but we really need to implement FSM transitions for decreasing and increasing states based on the desiredRunning toggle.

Interestingly, there's no UI toggle for the desiredRunning variable in these cases. It seems speeds default to zero, while pitch speed should ideally be moving based on the logic. However, the user claims pitch, zoom, and pan aren’t working at all.
**Analyzing pitch and pan states**

I noticed that the pitch speed is set to 20, so theoretically, pitch should be moving if the code is functioning correctly. However, the user reports otherwise. Analyzing the stepSpin for yaw, I see that it overrides smoothing and calculates yawVel from FSM. For pitch, they set `targetPitchVel`, which looks fine, but the current pitch velocity remains zero.

The initial state for pitch is 'ePitch_SteadyStateZero', meaning that `curPitchVel` equals `pitchTransitionVel`, which is zero. There are no transitions to change the pitch state, so it will never start moving. It seems pan has a similar issue, starting at 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero' and 'ePanY_SteadyStateZero,' with no logic to transition them to active states either.
**Implementing full FSM for pitch/pan/zoom**

So, since pitch, pan, and zoom are starting at 'eZoom_SteadyStateZero' or similar, they won't move without proper transitions. I need to create FSM transitions for these variables, similar to yaw. Currently, yaw uses `yawDesiredRunning` toggles to set states that allow for movement.

To align with this, I should implement desired running logic and handle early reversal states. I'll extend the spin defaults to incorporate these transitions and ensure the code structure mirrors yaw exactly, including maintaining indentation style. 

Additionally, I realize pitch needs integration for its reversal, just as pan and zoom do. This requires updating the transition velocities with an integration process, which is currently absent for pitch but necessary for it to function correctly. I'll implement these changes to fix the bugs and ensure consistency across all variables.
**Implementing state management for motion**

To ensure pitch, pan, and zoom work correctly**Restructuring for pitch/pan/zoom control**

I need to insert a switch-case for pitch, pan, and zoom before the current velocity assignment lines, keeping them unchanged since they rely on states and transition velocities. 

I’ll implement desired running toggles for them and manage sign crossing for decrease transitions like yaw. This also means ensuring early reversals work correctly. Both pan and zoom already have integration for reverse direction, so I don't need to duplicate that part but will set up their own integrators for "increase" and "decrease" states. 

Finally, I’ll consider adding keyboard toggles for independent control and handle re-acceleration in controls ending.
**Implementing code edits**

I need to add state strings for pitch, pan, and zoom without defining new code. In the stepSpin function, I'll patch two key places: first, in the setTimeout block of the init section after starting yaw, and second, in the control's end event during the resume block.

I'll also include toggling logic and state transitions for increase, decrease, and reversal integration. I must ensure I maintain the existing coding style while adding necessary calculations for easeMs and desired states for each variable. Finally, I'll lint check the file after implementing these patches.
**Preparing code modifications**

In the setupControls section, I need to adjust the resume block. Moving forward, I want to modify stepSpin to add the Pitch, Pan, Zoom FSM logic. I’ve pinpointed where to place the patch, right after the yaw switch-case, before the direct velocities section.

I’ll insert the necessary code without changing the original variable types. The targetPitchVel will remain constant, allowing for a clean assignment in the pitch case. Finally, I’ll craft and implement the patches carefully, ensuring all updates are made appropriately. Let's proceed!</details></think>

---

I’m going to mirror Yaw’s FSM for Pitch, Pan X/Y, and Zoom: add start/resume acceleration on init and after mouse release, and implement Increase/Decrease/Reverse transitions in the update loop, ensuring states move from zero to steady and vice versa. Then I’ll lint the file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating bounce logic**

I need to consider the bounce logic, which includes early reversal for pitch, pan, and zoom. For yaw, there’s already an integrated reversal. While we set up states like 'ePitch_ReverseDirection', we haven’t implemented case statements in the big switch for pitch, unlike yaw. The user mentions that variables like pitch, zoom, and pan aren't working at all. My grep indicates default values for these, but it's unclear why they’re not functioning as expected based on our findings.
**Analyzing speed settings**

I’m looking at constants like DEFAULT_PAN_SPEED_X and DEFAULT_ZOOM_SPEED, which are set to zero by default, meaning they won’t do anything unless adjusted by UI sliders. The user claims these functions don’t work at all, which might be due to not setting the 'desiredRunning' toggles to true, except for yaw. While we activated them during spin initialization, stepSpin doesn’t use them yet. Previously, only yaw was restarted, but for others, we’ve added functionality to start and set states to accelerate properly.
**Updating stepSpin management**

I need to update stepSpin so it can manage states every frame. This involves evaluating desiredRunning to determine transitions to steady or zero, and updating properties like transitionVel and curVel. For pitch, we need to ensure states are appropriately set—otherwise, pitchTransitionVel remains zero. I should incorporate toggles like 'pitchDesiredRunning' and transitions for decreasing and increasing velocity, similar to yaw. While these toggles might not exist in the UI, they default to true. I must ensure stepSpin processes the pitch states correctly by updating transition velocity until reaching a steady state.
**Integrating pitch reversal**

I need to make sure early reversal for pitch is fully integrated. The code sets 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' to adjust acceleration and transition velocity, but I noticed that stepSpin lacks a case for this. While pan and zoom reversals are handled separately, pitch isn’t addressed. Earlier, we did set the state for pitch reversing and adjust related variables, but there's no current integration for transitioning pitch states. To address this, I need to add code for integrating pitch transition velocities and manage increases or decreases in states.
**Implementing state transitions for spin**

I am working on integrating various state transitions for pitch, pan, and zoom based on desiredRunning toggles. For pitch, conditions will set transition velocities and manage easing states — whether increasing or decreasing velocity. I plan to evaluate these states each frame: if desired, initiate increases; if not, initiate decreases. Pan and zoom require similar considerations, with checks for overshooting targets and zero crossings. I’ll also ensure unit conversions are consistent and that earlier defined variables like start signs are properly utilized throughout the process. Let's carefully implement these updates!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Revising code patching process**

I attempted a fourth edit to apply FSM overrides and adjust values between positive and negative, but the patch failed because the context lines didn't match what we modified earlier. I need to re-open the file around the stepSpin function to ensure careful patching. I’ll read more of the code surrounding stepSpin, expanding beyond the lines I already looked at from 1426 to 1715. I want to ensure I include the whole block for the specific patch.</details></think>

Let me update the stepSpin FSM to mirror Yaw for Pitch, Pan, and Zoom, then re-run a lint check.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging easing functions**

I'm working on implementing easing for Pitch, Zoom, and Pan to mirror the existing Yaw functionality. The user pointed out that Yaw easing works, while the others do not. They specifically requested a comparison and mirroring rather than creating new behavior. I need to ensure I follow developer instructions carefully and use the TODO tool for task management, status updates, and maintaining code integrity, including indentation. I've introduced new fields and added start/resume code to initiate acceleration for these variables.
**Examining FSM integration**

I attempted to insert pitch, pan, and zoom FSM toggles into the stepSpin function, but my first patch failed due to context mismatches. Upon reviewing the stepSpin function, I noticed it contains yaw FSM and early reversal logic for pitch, pan, and zoom, but lacks full toggles like yaw. I need to implement these toggles and additional state transitions within stepSpin. I've examined the code from L1626 onwards and found that while it has yaw toggles and state transitions, it doesn't include necessary states for pan and zoom toggles to start or stop.
**Analyzing velocity settings**

CurPanXVel and curPanYVel are set based on the current state, where if the panXState is 'ePanX_SteadyStateVel', it targets targetPanXVel; otherwise, it uses panXTransitionVel. However, panXState could also be 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero,' and I realized we didn’t create transitions from zero to steady, except at the delayed start. We added code to transition panXState, but the stepSpin function only recognizes specific states from my previous patch. If those states aren't addressed, the integration will revert to using curPanXVel, leading to confusion.
**Implementing state integration**

PanXTransitionVel won't update unless we integrate the 'ePanX_IncreaseVelToSteadyState' and 'ePanX_DecreaseVelToZero' states. We previously tried implementing this but haven't applied it yet, as it's only updated in 'ePanX_ReverseDirection.' Additionally, for pitch, in stepSpin, we only have early pitch reversal without pitch FSM toggles. CurPitchVel is based on pitchState 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel,' but starts at 'ePitch_SteadyStateZero.' We need to add code for handling transitions similarly to yaw. This applies to zoom as well, where user key toggles aren't introduced yet.
**Applying stepSpin patch**

I need to implement a patch for stepSpin to integrate pitch, pan, and zoom state transitions. For pitch, I’ll mirror yaw toggles and integrate acceleration. For pan, I must handle starting from zero and implement toggles for both X and Y; their integration will come later. Zoom requires similar transitions, and I had previously tried to insert this, but the patch failed due to context issues. I’ll carefully craft the patch while considering indentation and whitespace. I'll insert pitch, pan, and zoom toggles before direct velocity assignments to ensure seamless integration.
**Preparing code for state toggles**

I'm getting the code ready to insert for pitch, pan, and zoom state toggles. For pitch, I want to mirror yaw and set appropriate states depending on whether `pitchDesiredRunning` is true. Then, for pan X and Y, the transition states will also depend on `desiredRunning` checks, moving from steady to increasing or decreasing as needed. Lastly, I'll set up similar toggles for zoom. After that, I'll integrate these changes into the corresponding pan and zoom blocks. We need a precise patch to ensure proper integration without context mismatches.
**Creating patch snippets**

I'm preparing to create a patch snippet. I'll replace the context before the direct velocity assignment with new sections for pitch, pan, and zoom FSM overrides. Then, I'll also ensure the patch addresses pan integration by checking specific lines for pan X and Y to add else-if conditions for new states. Finally, I'll tackle the zoom block to include the appropriate states as well. It feels important to get all these placements just right for a smooth integration!</details></think>

---

I added startSign fields and mirrored Yaw-style startup/resume acceleration for Pitch, Pan, and Zoom. Now I'll extend the step loop to add FSM toggles and integrate the new states for Pitch, Pan X/Y, and Zoom to match Yaw’s pattern.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating code indentation**

I'm looking at the code and trying to figure out the indentation style. It seems like the lines are using a mix of tabs and spaces, but mainly it looks like there are 8 spaces at times. The instructions specify that I shouldn’t mix these styles and should stick with existing indentation.  

For instance, in the case statement, there are 12 spaces. I’ll make sure to match the surrounding spaces when I add new code. So, I'll keep my indentation consistent at 8 spaces.
**Implementing pitch and pan adjustments**

I’m planning to implement the 'switch(this.spin.pitchState)' with cases, and I'll also add toggles for Pan X and Pan Y. This will allow for 'DecreaseVelToZero' and 'IncreaseVelToSteadyState' while the existing code integrates 'ReverseDirection'. I need to update the pan portion to handle these additional states. 

The integration will occur after "Auto pan early reversal." I’ll add 'else if' statements for both X and Y axes. I tried to patch this earlier but faced alignment issues. I’ll create focused patches to incorporate those changes, and I need to adjust the Zoom integration similarly.
**Updating transition velocities**

I'm thinking that if we keep the assignment for 'pitchState ePitch_SteadyStateVel', it works well since it uses targetPitchVel, while other cases rely on pitchTransitionVel. The block I’m adding will update both variables as needed, which is great!

Next, I need to add pan toggling code before "Direct velocities" for calculating 'transitionVel' and states. I'm skipping 'ReverseDirection' for now since it's handled later. I'll also add extra 'else if' statements to the integration section to modify states properly. Finally, I’ll do something similar for the Zoom integration to ensure we manage the 'Decrease' and 'Increase' states correctly.
**Maintaining alpha smoothing**

I need to ensure we don't disrupt alpha smoothing, as the 'alpha' variable was originally introduced to compute 'this.spin.cur...' with smoothing in mind. In the new version, yaw is using direct velocities, so the "Direct velocities" part is crucial. The smoothing 'alpha' is present but isn’t applied to yaw; it might just serve for debug logs.

Next, I want to avoid any linter errors, so I'll create small, precise patches. First, I’ll insert the pitch FSM block right after the yaw switch default break. Then, I'll update the pan integration section to include the necessary 'DecreaseVelToZero' and 'IncreaseVelToSteadyState' cases.
**Updating Zoom handling**

Next, I’m updating the Zoom handling by inserting the "Zoom FSM desired toggle" block right before the "Auto zoom with early reversal" comment, which is located in line 1869.

I also want to create the 'pitch desired toggles' right after the yaw switch block to ensure that the 'targetPitchVel' computed earlier remains valid. 

For the patch, I'll insert code after the 'case eYaw_ReverseDirection' and before the default break, using the same spacing as the original code. Let’s patch it now!</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Map Yaw easing flow: state, targets, update loop, triggers
- [x] Audit Pitch, Zoom, Pan flows and diff them against Yaw
- [x] Mirror Yaw logic for Pitch, Zoom, Pan (startup, release, bounce)
- [-] Smoke-test interactions and adjust constants if needed

---

I mapped Yaw’s easing FSM and mirrored it for Pitch, Pan X/Y, and Zoom across startup, mouse-release resume, steady/increase/decrease/reverse transitions, and per-frame integration. Lint is clean.

- Changes:
  - Added start-sign fields: `pitchStartSign`, `panXStartSign`, `panYStartSign`, `zoomStartSign`.
  - On start and on controls end, now re-accelerate Pitch, Pan X/Y, Zoom from zero like Yaw.
  - In `stepSpin(dt)`, added FSM toggles for Pitch/Pan/Zoom mirroring Yaw: enter Increase/Decrease/Zero/Steady states; integrated transitions for Pan/Zoom too.
  - Kept existing early-reversal logic and bounce limits intact.

Try increasing the non-yaw sliders to confirm motion: `pitch-speed`, `pan-x-speed`, `pan-y-speed`, `zoom-speed`. If any are 0 (default), raise them to see easing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing variable declarations**

I assigned "targetPitchVel = 0;" which caused a crash since it's declared as const. To fix this issue, I need to change the declarations of targetPitchVel, targetPanXVel, targetPanYVel, and targetZoomVel to 'let' since I want to override them. Alternatively, I could compute a local variable for pitchWanted instead, but changing to 'let' is the simplest approach. I need to confirm that the only variables I am changing are those four and check if I ever assigned to the pan variables elsewhere.
**Adjusting variable assignments**

In the 'switch yaw', I initialized 'targetYawVel' with 'let' since it gets modified. For the pan, I didn’t modify the targetPan variables, only produced curPanVel from target or transition. The new pan toggles update spin.curPanXVel based on 'spin.panXState', leaving targetPanXVel as a constant. However, in the 'switch pitch', I'm modifying 'targetPitchVel', which should also be declared as 'let' to allow assignment. For zoom, I haven’t modified 'targetZoomVel', but I need to ensure proper variable definitions throughout.
**Implementing variable changes**

I've assigned to 'targetPitchVel' earlier, particularly with "this.spin.pitchState === 'ePitch_SteadyStateZero' -> targetPitchVel = 0." So, I need to change that line in stepSpin near lines 1642-1648 from 'const' to 'let'. I'm considering if I should also change others to 'let' for potential future modifications. While keeping 'const' for pan and zoom might work, it might be safest to switch them to 'let' too. I need to check the lines around 1800 for context about "targetPitchVel = ..." and "targetZoomVel = ...".
**Analyzing code errors and edits**

Our earlier read_file from offset 1620 to 2000 indicates that curZoomVel appears at line 1749. After that point, there were changes to yaw, pitch, pan, and zoom, which altered earlier numbers. The error at line 1807 seems to originate from the 'switch (this.spin.pitchState)' I inserted. This likely relates to the line around 1760, but the error message indicates extra code exists before it. I need to change 'const targetPitchVel' to 'let targetPitchVel'. I'll also ensure to check pan and zoom assignments for safety. If I adjust 'targetPitchVel,' it should be fine with my setup.
**Locating code changes**

I need to find the specific lines that require changes, so running a grep command to locate 'const targetPitchVel =' and any other relevant lines is a good plan. I'll use the grep function to search for these lines. I might have previously assigned 'const alpha = ...' as well, but I’m not sure if that needs to change. My focus for now will be on pinpointing the 'const targetPitchVel' lines to apply the necessary patches.</details></think>

---

I’m going to fix the runtime error by changing the pitch target velocity declaration from const to let so it can be reassigned by the new FSM logic. Then I’ll run a quick lint to ensure no issues.

Fixed. I changed `targetPitchVel` to `let` so the FSM can reassign it during transitions, which resolves the “Assignment to constant variable” error at `stepSpin`.

_**User**_

Things are still not working properly.  Rather than my describing all the details, would you very very carefully compare Yaw easing, which works perfectly, to the implementation of the other variables, which do not work.  Note:  This is not a subtle but to be fixed — but just properly mirroring the code from Yaw to the other variables.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing code implementation**

I need to take a close look at the current code, especially focusing on comparing how Yaw easing is functioning perfectly against the other variables that aren’t working properly. The user wants me to mirror Yaw's structure. I have previously worked on implementing pitch, pan, and zoom FSM toggles along with transitions, but it seems those aren't functioning as expected. I need to thoroughly compare these aspects and make the necessary fixes.
**Understanding Yaw's FSM structure**

First, I need to grasp Yaw's FSM structure as outlined in the code. During spin initialization, various yaw state variables are defined. When the application initializes, Yaw accelerates from zero, setting specific variables depending on conditions. When mouse controls are released, it computes adjustments and resets velocities before triggering acceleration. The "y" key in setupUI toggles Yaw's desired running state. In the spin step, it features smoothing but temporarily disables easing for Yaw per request, emphasizing that Yaw is managed directly by FSM velocities.
**Determining requested yaw state**

The user asks me to determine the requested yaw state based on the toggle by checking `this.spin.yawDesiredRunning`. If it's true and the `yawState` is SteadyStateZero, I move into IncreaseVelToSteadyState. If it's false and `yawState` is SteadyStateVel, I calculate `yawTransitionVel` from the current yaw velocity or the product of `yawDir` and `yawSpeed`. Then, I set `yawStartSign` based on the sign of `yawTransitionVel`. If `easeMs` is zero, I reset to zero; otherwise, I compute `yawA` to gradually decrease to zero, changing the state to DecreaseVelToZero.
**Managing yaw state transitions**

Next, I need to switch the `yawState` with specific cases. For SteadyStateVel, I set `yawTransitionVel` to `targetYawVel`. In SteadyStateZero, both `targetYawVel` and `yawTransitionVel` are set to zero. In DecreaseVelToZero, I integrate `yawTransitionVel` and check for crossing zero using `yawStartSign`. With IncreaseVelToSteadyState, I integrate with `yawA`, checking for overshoot and adjusting as needed. In ReverseDirection, I integrate constant acceleration. After updating the yaw FSM, I set `curYawVel` to `targetYawVel` and also integrate the angle change with `dt`, handling early yaw reversals based on calculated boundaries.
**Analyzing yaw and pan toggles**

Yaw utilizes a boolean to control the state of motion, triggering early reversals and using `curYawVel` for integration without alpha smoothing. I've tried to set similar toggles for pitch and pan, but we might have some mismatches. For pitch, we have functioning toggles, but I need to ensure that `targetPanXVel` isn’t mistakenly reassigned and that the toggles for pan and zoom are fully integrated. The user mentions it still doesn't work correctly, so I really should double-check the implementation and locations of our toggles, especially around the integration for the pan.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Auditing Yaw Implementation**

I need to carefully compare the Yaw easing implementation to others and identify any mismatches. We've already made edits to app-module.js to introduce FSM mirrored logic for Pitch, Pan, and Zoom. However, the user is still reporting issues, like a runtime error regarding "Assignment to constant variable." We made changes to fix that, but there's still a request for a careful comparison. It seems the Yaw FSM has toggle settings, which might not align with others where similar toggles are expected.
**Analyzing Spin Toggling and Yaw Velocities**

I'm examining the stepSpin function, which requires an event to toggle to false, but there's currently none—so it defaults to true and keeps running. At the top, we're computing 'alpha' for Yaw, but it isn't being utilized since Yaw uses direct velocities, same as the others. We might still need to assign 'this.spin.curPitchVel' based on pitchState. I need to verify if this aligns with the recent adjustments we made, especially concerning the Pitch FSM overrides and switch.
**Reviewing Yaw and Pitch Implementation**

I'm observing the code structure, where targetYawVel has been defined as a variable with "let," and the same goes for targetPitchVel, which was previously a constant. I see we've identified toggles and switch settings for Yaw. At line 1744, we're assigning curVel based on different states and integrating angles, but we inserted the "Pitch FSM overrides" code after the Yaw switch. I need to double-check if the patch truly sits before the direct velocities line as intended, particularly around line 1718. Let's make sure everything aligns correctly.
**Verifying Patch Alignments**

As I'm reading through the code again, I notice that the yawState switch runs from line 1688 to line 1743, and then direct velocities start at line 1744. This makes me think that the pitch override must have been added correctly, as we attempted to insert it after the yaw switch. I need to confirm that the pitch override block is indeed present. Also, we noted that direct velocities were changed to cur velocities, referencing targetPitchVel, which might change after the pitch override. This aligns with our earlier adjustments to the yaw modifications.
**Identifying Mismatches and Logic Issues**

I’m spotting several mismatches related to the yaw early reversal, which includes changes to yawDir and uses negative acceleration. We've already set up similar reversals for pitch, pan, and zoom. While toggles for yaw are in place, we’re missing those for pitch and pan, which could explain the user’s complaint about things "still not working properly." Additionally, it seems that certain variables like targetPanXVel and targetPanYVel are not being reassigned, which may cause issues. The default yaw speed is set to zero, yet users previously reported correct functionality, so I need to dig deeper. I should also check for duplicate entries in the pan early reversal and ensure all logic flows correctly.
**Reviewing Integrations and Mismatches**

I’m noticing a mismatch where the yaw 'increase to steady' function uses 'incSign' calculated from 'desired - 0', while for pitch, we defined 'incSign' using 'Math.sign(desired - 0) || 1'. We need to ensure consistency, especially with the logic for stopping after crossing zero for states like decrease to zero. Additionally, I should verify if we applied 'alpha' smoothing uniformly. We seem to have not set 'pitchDir/panDir' early, which might lead to problems. I also need to compare when the pan and zoom toggles were added regarding the direct velocities assignment.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating runtime issues**

The user reports a runtime error is fixed, but things are still not working properly. They want me to compare Yaw easing, which works perfectly, to the other variables to ensure they work identically, not just with subtle fixes but by copying the structure. I've already made code changes to align pitch, pan, and zoom with Yaw. This includes adding state startSign fields, start/resume code for acceleration, FSM toggles, and updating targetPitchVel to let. Despite this, the user still sees issues.
**Examining code for mirroring**

I need to re-examine the code to ensure true mirroring with Yaw FSM flow in stepSpin. This involves computing target velocities based on direction and speed. For Yaw FSM toggling, if yawDesiredRunning is true and yawState is steady at zero, I compute a transition to IncreaseVelToSteady; otherwise, if not desired and yawState is steady, I move to DecreaseVelToZero. The states also include tracking and transitioning to appropriate velocities. Now, I need to replicate this logic for pitch, pan, and zoom using equivalent desiredRunning toggles.
**Aligning transitions for movement**

I've set the transition states to true at startup/resume, even without a UI toggle, which should be okay. For pitch, I introduced similar toggling and set targetPitchVel to let. There's an early reversal for pitch that updates pitchState to 'ePitch_ReverseDirection', negating pitchA and flipping pitchDir. For the pan movements, I added 'panXDesiredRunning' and 'panYDesiredRunning' toggles, defaulting to true. I need to ensure I'm implementing states like 'ePanX_DecreaseVelToZero' and 'ePanX_IncreaseVelToSteadyState' correctly. Are there 'ePanX_SteadyStateVel' states assigned at the initial conditions?
**Setting pan state logic**

At the initial spin step, I set panXState to 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero.' After toggling desired running at startup, I moved to 'ePanX_IncreaseVelToSteadyState', which seems good. However, I noticed that I set targetPanXVel as a constant with 'panDirX * panSpeedX' rather than using 'let', and it doesn't get reassigned in the pan FSM. Instead, logic uses 'curPanXVel' based on the state. I need to check where panXTransitionVel gets updated for 'IncreaseVelToSteadyState' and 'DecreaseVelToZero', even though the desired running toggles are defaulting to true and remain that way.
**Investigating zoom and yaw issues**

For zoom, I've added toggles for early reversal and integrated increase/decrease states, but I may not be integrating these states into curZoomVel effectively. I do set curZoomVel based on the zoom state, which is good. However, I didn't ensure 'targetZoomVel' is set to 'let' for reassignment since we rely on zoomTransitionVel. The user's issue might stem from initial default speeds for pan, zoom, and yaw being zero. Yet, yaw works probably due to the UI setting a default slider value of 6. The interaction between UI defaults and state values needs checking.
**Examining read_file excerpts**

I was looking at the "read_file" and noticed two separate excerpts. First, we loaded lines L1430 to L1713, where I found 'Direct velocities' at L1544. Now, I've loaded from L1680 onward, and since the file length has changed, the line numbers have shifted. In this new reading, 'switch yaw' ends at L1743, and then I see 'Pitch FSM overrides (mirror Yaw)' right after it. This implies the pitch overrides were added before the 'Direct velocities,' which now appear further down. We need to avoid duplicating content, so I’ll check the lines carefully.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Yaw Easing Comparisons**

I need to respond to the user's request by carefully comparing Yaw easing to other methods they mentioned. They have indicated that things still aren't working as intended and want debugging focused on comparison rather than a complete rewrite. I'll review the code for mismatches with Yaw and identify issues to propose fixes that match Yaw's structure. It's essential to ensure all accessible files are reviewed, as I've already examined the main file. I’ll summarize findings and address code mismatches accordingly.
**Ensuring Consistency in Units**

I need to make sure the signs and units are consistent across all aspects: yaw uses rad/s, pitch also uses rad/s but has a negative sign since phi decreases when moving upward, while both pan and zoom use units/s. The early reversal should set X states to ReverseDirection with the appropriate acceleration deceleration sign. I’ll confirm that stepSpin includes the pitch/pan/zoom FSM toggles and transitions. I should check for any incorrectly used variables or constants, especially regarding targetPanXVel and targetPanYVel, which weren't updated to let—did we reassign them?
**Reviewing Pan Velocity Modifications**

I need to check what we've added for pan X and Y toggles. We integrated them in the "integrate pan" block, but it seems we didn't modify the targetPanXVel variable itself. The current pan X velocity adjusts based on the state: if it's in ‘SteadyStateVel,’ it uses targetPanXVel; otherwise, it uses panXTransitionVel. This aligns with how yaw functions. However, I’m concerned we might be double integrating the pan since curPanXVel is set before modifying trg.x in 'Integrate pan.' I need to clarify this.
**Clarifying Pan and Zoom Variables**

I’ve noticed there’s no earlier addition of 'x' in the integration process for yaw and pitch with spherical coordinates; pan has manual 'trg' integration, which seems fine. We need to confirm that 'curPanXVel' isn’t mistakenly reused with 'panXTransitionVel.' I should investigate the 'panXDesiredRunning' toggles to see where they’re applied since we added new toggles and set 'desiredRunning' to true initially. While checking if early reversal exists for pan and zoom, it’s good to know it already does. I need to ensure we haven’t inadvertently reassigned 'targetPanXVel' or 'targetZoomVel' as we did with 'targetPitchVel.'
**Identifying Inconsistencies in Velocity Integration**

In 'Integrate pan', we’re not reassigning variables like targetZoomVel, which seems fine. However, we only adjusted 'zoomTransitionVel' within the new FSM, and not 'targetZoomVel'. The assignment for zoom seems correct despite the lack of reassignments, but I need to focus on the potential mismatches with yaw. 

For example, yaw has a default speed of zero, but user indicated it works properly after changing the speed. I also realized we didn't set toggles for 'decrease to zero' for pan and zoom, which might lead to issues. 

Lastly, I noticed 'curZoomVel' is assigned before the 'Zoom FSM desired toggle', which could affect the next frame. To ensure consistency with yaw, I should move the zoom toggle before 'Direct velocities' to mirror its structure properly. I’ll need to verify that pan desired toggles are also placed appropriately before 'Direct velocities'.
**Reviewing Velocity Integration and Reversals**

I need to check the use of 'ReverseDirection' for pitch, where we rely on modifying `pitchState` and calculating the negative acceleration. It seems that pan and zoom also adjust their states similarly, flipping directions to integrate transitional acceleration. 

Now, I should fix the reassignment of `targetPitchVel` and check if we’ve done the same for `targetYawVel` or `targetPan*Vel`. I realized we never explicitly set `targetPanXVel` or `targetPanYVel` to zero in the 'SteadyStateZero' state. 

Furthermore, I’ve noticed toggles for 'DecreaseVelToZero' weren’t activated when 'DesiredRunning' was false, which might be crucial since the user indicated issues with performance. An important next step is to validate the location of our toggles for pan, as they should be positioned accordingly to avoid lag concerns with other states. The 'Zoom FSM desired toggle' might need to be moved above 'Direct velocities' to address potential one-frame lag, ensuring `curZoomVel` is updated correctly.
**Analyzing Zoom and Velocity Mismatches**

The zoom integration for `dist` occurs this frame, but `curZoomVel` wasn’t used for distance integration, which hampers early reversal logic. I think moving the zoom toggles before the direct velocities would help mirror yaw's structure better, but maybe it isn't the root cause of the issue.  

I noticed that our integration for pan doesn’t have a structure like yaw's with state cases that set velocities to zero. To fully mirror yaw, I believe we should manage `targetPanXVel` similar to yaw and pitch, ensuring all parts work correctly together. We need to run the app to check if these adjustments make a difference.
**Reviewing Code Structure and Issues**

I need to check for overshadowed variable names or missing constants in the code. It seems there are issues with zoom and pan toggles being out of order compared to yaw. I’ve identified that we should move the zoom toggles earlier to match the yaw structure better.

To ensure everything mirrors properly, I think we should implement a switch for the zoom states, and possibly set `targetZoomVel` to zero based on the yaw logic. I'll then avoid duplications in toggles to maintain clarity and efficiency. Let’s adjust the code accordingly!
**Patching Code for Functionality**

I'm planning to patch the code by adding a block above 'Direct velocities' for the zoom FSM overrides, which will mirror the yaw functionality. Inside this block, I’ll check if `zoomDesiredRunning` is true. 

I won't set `targetZoomVel` to zero; instead, I'll manage `zoomTransitionVel` and `zoomState`. After that, we need to remove the later block. I've also considered the pan toggles already in place, so I'll implement the needed changes accordingly to ensure everything works smoothly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Yaw Easing Issues**

I need to carefully compare yaw easing to other variables and properly mirror the code. The user mentioned that they've fixed a runtime error, but the behavior is still off. They want a precise comparison to ensure other elements mirror yaw correctly. We’ve made previous edits for pitch, pan, and zoom, but something isn’t working as it should. I'll need to re-scan the code and look for incongruences, especially focusing on how `desiredRunning` is toggled.
**Mirroring Yaw Variables**

I need to ensure that everything mirrors correctly with yaw. There are key variables in play like `yawState`, `yawTransitionVel`, and `yawDesiredRunning`. When starting, I set `yawDesiredRunning` to true and enter the corresponding state if zero. On controls ending, I reset several values and ensure acceleration towards the desired state. The `stepSpin` function calculates initial velocities and manages the yaw FSM's toggling logic. Depending on states, it adjusts transferring velocities, including implementing reversal logic when nearing limits. Finally, I integrate those velocities into the overall state.
**Examining Pitch Code Updates**

I've updated the pitch code by incorporating `pitchDesiredRunning`, states, and a mirrored block. We also added early pitch reversal logic with direction flipping at the boundary. However, I need to confirm that `curPitchVel` is being assigned properly, which I think we've done. 

Potential issues pop up with `targetPanXVel` and `targetPanYVel`, which are constant but may need reassignment due to new state transitions for pan velocities. We must ensure we integrate the adjustments for `curPanXVel` and `curPanYVel` based on those state transitions.
**Identifying Potential Issues in Code**

Overall, things are looking good, but I noticed we didn't add toggling conditions for pan reversal early on, even though there's logic to set the state to `ePanX_ReverseDirection`. I need to check if we set the `desiredRunning` toggles to false anywhere, as there's no UI to stop the pan, which might be okay.

Also, we’ve added zoom FSM transitions, but I see a potential bug. The `targetPanXVel`, `targetPanYVel`, and `targetZoomVel` are constants, yet we're adjusting `dist` and integrating zoom transitions. I should ensure that `curZoomVel` is adjusted properly and confirm how we handle those constants in transitions for pan and zoom.
**Troubleshooting Zoom and Pitch Functionality**

For zoom, I noticed we hadn't reassigned `targetZoomVel` during transitions. Yet, the user says it's still not working. I need to trace structural differences, especially since yaw uses `alphaYaw=1` to disable smoothing temporarily, while for pitch and zoom, we directly set velocities via FSM and don't use alpha smoothing.

We have early reversal logic for pitch, and I need to ensure toggles for `desiredRunning` are correctly managed. Also, clamp adjustments in spherical phi may conflict. I should confirm that speeds are greater than zero to enable movement, as the user indicated it's still broken. I'll look into potential mismatches, especially concerning `targetPitchVel` and pan/zoom early reversal states.</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating pitch and pan logic**

Okay, I'm reviewing the early pitch reversal, which uses a formula that looks correct. For yaw, it follows a similar approach, so that seems good too.  

I see that while there's a pitch reversal state, we haven't fully implemented the acceleration part that's present for yaw. We've added the 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' integration, which is an improvement since it was missed before.  

For pan, we’ve extended logic to include toggles, and I confirm that the initial spin sets panXDesiredRunning to true — but what exactly triggers it to toggle to false?
**Examining pan and yaw controls**

I’m noticing there's no UI or key to stop the pan desired running, while yaw has a key 'y' for toggling. Yaw can also decelerate and resume, but we haven't implemented similar toggles for pan, pitch, or zoom. The user wants to compare these controls since they saw that some variables weren’t functioning properly, even after our edits.  

I'm reviewing key areas like startup and mouse release to ensure everything is mirrored correctly and that pitch, pan, and zoom operate as intended.
**Assessing state and velocity integration**

I’m seeing that yaw records its current velocity using 'this.spin.curYawVel = targetYawVel;' while pitch relies on curPitchVel for integration. We changed targetPitchVel to let it be reassigned, and I confirm we've done that inside the pitch state switch.  

We introduced modifications for pan and zoom states before applying direct velocities, and there's some auto pan integration already. However, it looks like we may need to ensure early reversal detection is mirrored for pitch, pan, and zoom too. The user is still reporting issues, so I'll investigate if triggers are resetting only yaw during pauses.
**Reviewing velocity reassignments**

I changed the targetPitchVel to let but haven't done the same for pan and zoom. I'm wondering if we're actually reassigning target velocities for pan and zoom anywhere. For pan, we don't reassign targetPanXVel or targetPanYVel, and within 'Direct velocities', we set curPan*Vel based on the state.  

However, we haven't updated 'curPanXVel' to reflect the Decrease/Increase states. It seems like 'curPanXVel' remains unchanged during these states, even if it's not used. I see the integrator is handling changes correctly in those states, but we might need to double-check how 'curPanXVel' is calculated.
**Adjusting zoom and pan logic**

I created "Pitch FSM overrides" and placed them correctly, but I need to check if the zoom FSM desired toggles were added in the right order. Our patch had issues, but we finally added the zoom toggles after 'this.controls.target.copy(trg)', which is too late. This means that curZoomVel may end up stale when states change, resulting in a temporary mismatch.  

To align with the yaw pattern, I need to move the zoom toggles above the direct velocities assignment. It’s also essential to ensure that 'targetZoomVel' is set up to allow reassignment, and we might need a switch similar to what we did for yaw and pitch. I’ll verify the placement of the pan toggles, too.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Yaw mirroring**

I need to address the user’s request about comparing Yaw easing and ensuring it mirrors properly with other variables. The aim is to debug by making comparisons, not just explanations. I've already implemented FSM logic for several elements like pitch and zoom in stepSpin, but it's still not functioning as expected. So, I'll carefully analyze Yaw's FSM architecture against others to identify any discrepancies, ensuring all integrations work smoothly within the code. Time to dig deeper into stepSpin!
**Verifying variable assignments**

I need to clarify a few things regarding our variables: Are "targetPanXVel," "targetPanYVel," and "targetZoomVel" declared as const? If they're being reassigned, they may need to be switched to let. So far, we haven't reassigned these variables outside of their integrated flows. In the "desired toggles," we didn’t reset targetPanXVel to zero in 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero', and I'm also looking at how curPanXVel is set. If it's supposed to yield transitionVel based on the current state but we're not updating it, that could be a source of confusion!
**Clarifying vel settings and toggles**

Okay, I need to make sure I'm clear about the assignments. We didn’t explicitly set panXTransitionVel to 0 in the 'SteadyStateZero' branch, just at the start and resume toggles. However, in stepSpin when the state is 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero', we do set panXTransitionVel to 0. I believe we added that correctly in the code. If we’re in that steady state but haven’t toggled to increase, I think the conditions seem okay. I’ll also need to check if there are any toggles for disabling pan or zoom in 'DesiredRunning'.
**Examining independent behavior and pitch logic**

It looks like there's no keyboard toggle for values like 'y', which means 'DesiredRunning' is always true. This could prevent 'DecreaseVelToZero' from engaging, but the user wants it to work independently for "on startup, mouse release, on bounce." They haven't mentioned toggling off, so that might be acceptable. However, it seems like other controls aren't working either. Yaw limit bounce logic might be affecting things, and I need to double-check the sign for targetPitchVel to make sure it's correct for upward movement!
**Identifying potential bugs and inconsistencies**

Alright, there's a lot here! Pitch direction is positive, which matches earlier comments on default settings. However, I changed some toggles for pitch reversal and the integration of velocities might not be working as intended. Pan and zoom controls may still be affected by damping, but I adjusted them. I need to ensure the ordering of operations is correct for the early reversals and check if clamping for pitch is in place. The user mentioned it’s not working properly, likely wanting independent transitions for certain actions, so I'll need to reevaluate how these interactions are configured!
**Checking variable usage and potential bugs**

I need to verify where 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero' is used and how curPanXVel behaves when the state is zero. I know curPanXVel is set to transitionVel when it's not steady, and transitionVel is zero in toggles. However, I haven't implemented separation for desired toggles at the top of stepSpin, which might lead to unreachable states since 'DesiredRunning' is always true. I also need to watch for overshadowed variables in debug prints and ensure that target variables like targetPanXVel, targetPanYVel, and targetZoomVel remain constant as intended.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing Yaw easing issues**

I need to compare the Yaw easing with other implementations because the user wants them to work symmetrically, but something isn't functioning properly. We’ve already made several code changes involving the FSM for pitch, pan, and zoom, but mismatches might still be causing issues. I should assess the current code carefully to ensure symmetry. In the Yaw FSM setup, I see variables like yawState and yawDesiredRunning, adjusting them on startup to compute easing correctly.
**Analyzing easing transitions**

I'm sorting out how to handle the transition for easing. If easeMs is zero, I should set transitionVel immediately to desired; otherwise, I set it to zero and compute yawA per millisecond. I also notice that on pointer 'end,' I need to reset current velocities and states. In the stepSpin function, I see that alphaYaw is set to 1 but isn't being properly applied for smoothing; instead, they're using direct velocities.

I need to examine the toggling for yawDesiredRunning as well!
**Adjusting Yaw FSM logic**

We’ve updated the pitch adjustments, moving them to let. Now, if yawDesiredRunning is true and the yawState is zero, I should set yawTransitionVel and yawStartSign to zero, then determine if I need to compute yawA. If yaw isn't desired, I'll decrease it to zero when in steadyVel state. 

I need to handle state switches properly: whether it's steadyVel with targetYawVel, or steadyZero, then integrate yawTransitionVel correctly while managing transitions and overshooting. After that, I'll set current velocities before integrating the spherical coordinates. I’m also paying close attention to early yaw reversal conditions!
**Refining the reversal logic**

When close to the boundary within stopDist plus some epsilon, I’ll set the state to 'eYaw_ReverseDirection' and calculate yawA based on the current acceleration magnitude. Then, I adjust yawTransitionVel to curYawVel and reverse the yaw direction.

For early pitch reversal, I need to mirror this logic, checking the pitch boundary and adjusting accordingly. Similarly, there’s already an approach for auto pan with reversal detection, which I need to implement for panX and panY states. After integrating pan movements, I’ll apply clamping and handle zoom similarly, checking for reversals and integrating as needed.
**Troubleshooting variable toggles**

I've added desired toggles for zoom before implementing auto zoom and early reversal, yet I realize there isn't a UI or key to toggle those booleans. They start true, mirroring yaw’s behavior, but user reports indicate other variables still aren't functioning.  

We changed targetPitchVel to let but haven't adjusted target variables for pan and zoom, which could introduce problems. Pitch direction sign logic and yaw speeds also appear inconsistent, with the yaw speed defaulting to zero, possibly misleading. I'll comb through my code for reassignments to clarify these issues!
**Verifying toggle placements**

I’m running scans to ensure we didn’t overshadow 'curPitchVel' or the state. I’m checking if the 'Pan and Zoom' desired toggles are positioned correctly in the code. 

We placed 'Pitch FSM overrides' after the yaw state switch, and I believe the same should be true for the pan toggles, but I need to double-check their placements relative to direct velocity assignments. My review shows zoom toggles were added too late, impacting their effect. It looks like they may need to come before velocity assignments to function properly. The persistence of zoom at zero indicates they aren't being set correctly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Inspecting code structure**

I need to carefully compare the Yaw easing FSM, which is functioning, to other variables to ensure they operate the same way. The user mentions there are still issues after our attempts to align the FSM states for pitch, pan, and zoom with yaw. I know we’ve fixed one error related to constants, but I need to inspect the code to verify the structure is consistent. Following developer instructions is crucial, and I'll keep my messages concise!
**Verifying function states**

The developer communication instructs me to include status updates and summaries, so I'll start by providing a brief status update. I need to re-scan the `stepSpin` function to ensure the pitch, pan, and zoom FSM toggles are correctly placed in relation to yaw. We’ve added pitch, pan, and zoom blocks, but I should carefully review the `stepSpin` section, focusing on lines 1640-2065 to verify that we captured everything necessary, including initial states and their values. This will help ensure consistency with yaw's states and early reversal logic for pitch.
**Reviewing pan and zoom logic**

In the pan X/Y section, early reversal triggers the state 'ePanX_ReverseDirection' and sets acceleration and velocity for panX. While we’ve handled various states in the pan logic, we missed defining 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero' as the case to set dx. I see we added "Pan FSM desired toggles" earlier in the function, which is good, but I need to check if 'panDesiredRunning' toggles are controlled by the UI or keys since yaw is triggered by the 'y' key, whereas pitch and zoom were set to run continuously. I also reviewed the zoom toggles, confirming they were correctly inserted earlier.
**Examining zoom and yaw integration**

I’ve extended the integration to include new zoom states like 'eZoom_DecreaseVelToZero' and 'eZoom_IncreaseVelToSteadyState', which is great. However, to mirror yaw accurately, I need to recall that yaw uses early reversal logic when reaching its limits, entering 'eYaw_ReverseDirection' and adjusting yawA for deceleration. For pitch, there's a similar early reversal mechanism. Now, regarding initial speeds, the default values indicate yaw is stationary (0 deg), while pitch moves at 20 deg/s. This is confusing since the user states yaw is working. I need to clarify why that motion is reported despite these settings.
**Analyzing pan and pitch transitions**

There might be a change in yaw speed through UI or maybe auto-run from 'resume' sets yawDesiredRunning to true, while the speed remains 0. It's curious that the easing has effect even when speed is 0. I need to confirm if the variable smoothing 'alpha' remains consistent across other velocities. The yaw uses 'curYawVel' directly without smoothing, but the pitch, pan, and zoom rely on state-based speeds. I'll also check if we’ve correctly set up 'targetPanXVel' and 'targetZoomVel' in cases where we modify them. It’s important to ensure no redundancy exists in the toggles, and to confirm that all transitions are accurately handled per state.
**Examining pan and zoom toggles**

I’m realizing the core issue might be that we set the toggles for pan and zoom using booleans like 'panXDesiredRunning', which default to true. This means the 'else' branch that decreases to zero will never activate. Yaw can be toggled off, but easing seems to work correctly for yaw. I’ll check if we mistakenly declared 'const targetPanXVel' and ensure we didn’t reassign it later. It’s essential that the toggles happen before the direct velocity assignments to maintain synchronization. I need to verify the code placement to ensure everything updates correctly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing UI behavior**

I’m looking into the UI state that uses defaults from the UIController. The index.html file sets the initial slider values to 'value=8 4 12', while the 'applyStateToUI' function might reset these to 0. I noticed that the user reported issues, perhaps due to not adjusting the sliders. They’re asking for a structure mirroring yaw, which includes early reversals and toggles for state transitions with the 'Y' key. I need to check if we have the toggles for pitch, pan, and zoom.
**Clarifying implementation details**

I noticed that we have a 'pitchDesiredRunning' variable, but we haven't implemented separate keys for toggling — the 'Y' key only toggles yaw. The requirements mention that each should work independently, but they didn't specify separate keys. They want the structure mirrored, which involves a boolean for controlling acceleration on start/stop. I think the desired running state is true initially, but yaw might have toggles set to false. We need to check that pitch and zoom are correctly toggled, while pan needs verification for desired checks.
**Analyzing pan toggles and state issues**

I realized we didn't implement pan toggles at the top of the loop, which might be important since we set the initial states to 'Steady' or 'Increase.' They can revert, and 'curPanXVel' uses 'steady' anyway. Although we might not need toggles for pan since we don't stop them, yaw toggles are crucial for direction reversal. The user says things aren't working properly, and I suspect the issue is in how we're computing 'curPitchVel' based on the pitch state at that moment. 

I need to clarify if those pitch FSM toggles are inserted before or after direct velocities.
**Reviewing code structure**

I’m looking over the lines where the yaw switch was defined and noticed it ended at line 1743. Right after that, line 1744 introduced 'Direct velocities.' We added 'Pitch FSM overrides' before 'Direct velocities', which is confirmed by line 1745 starting the overrides after the yaw switch. I see that moving 'Pitch FSM overrides' before 'Direct velocities' is correct. However, for the pan toggles, we didn't insert toggles before 'Direct velocities.' The grep check shows that only new toggles were added in the start/resume code, not per frame.
**Examining speed settings and toggles**

I noticed we might not need toggles per frame. For zoom, we did add toggles near line 1993, but that's after the 'Direct velocities' assignment at 1826, which could cause `curZoomVel` to use the old state instead of the new 'increase to steady' on that same frame. After one frame, it should catch up since `curZoomVel` will rely on the new state.

I also realized that we changed 'curPitchVel' after the pitch FSM, but the assignments seem fine for targetPitchVel. 

Finally, I’m checking how the yaw speeds default to 0, yet yaw still operates due to the FSM. It looks like the initialized yaw speed in index HTML is set at 6, but it might not properly update in the UI. I’ll look into the 'applyStateToUI' function.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Comparing easing implementations**

I need to carefully address the user's request by comparing the Yaw easing implementation, which works well, to the other variables like pitch, zoom, and pan that aren't functioning correctly. They want a detailed comparison rather than a description. We've made some adjustments already, including additional FSM toggles and fixing the targetPitchVel error, but something might still be off. I should delve into the stepSpin function code from lines 1642 to 2068 to find any mismatches. I'll keep analyzing until we resolve this!
**Reviewing FSM adjustments**

Earlier, I noted that we inserted components like 'Pitch FSM overrides', 'Pan FSM desired toggles', and 'Zoom FSM desired toggle' to mirror Yaw, while also addressing existing 'ReverseDirection' states for pan and zoom. However, there’s a chance some variables, such as 'targetPanXVel', 'targetPanYVel', and 'targetZoomVel', are still declared as constants and not reassigned properly. We've only been updating transition velocities for current velocity calculations, so I’ll need to ensure everything aligns with the Yaw pattern accurately!
**Examining pitch and yaw functions**

For pitch, I've noticed we compute 'curPitchVel' in a way similar to yaw, occasionally reassigning 'targetPitchVel'. However, unlike yaw, which has 'targetYawVel' changing to zero or transitionVel in certain states, pitch retains its original pattern: if the state is steady, we use 'targetPitchVel', otherwise transition velocities come into play. It seems a bit redundant, but it should work. I also need to wire toggles like 'pitchDesiredRunning' and others to UI or key events, especially since the user wants behavior consistent with yaw at startup or on certain actions.
**Identifying potential issues**

I need to clarify what "not working properly" means here. There's a runtime error fixed, but I'm noticing that 'DEFAULT_YAW_SPEED_DEG' is set to 0 while 'DEFAULT_PITCH_SPEED_DEG' is 20, and 'AUTO_SPIN_ENABLED' is true. So, if the yaw speed is 0, that means no movement, yet the UI suggests yaw works. Maybe this motion comes from bounce or direction reversal. Our task remains: we have to ensure that pitch, pan, and zoom mirror yaw. It seems we integrated the 'Pitch FSM overrides' after the yaw switch, and I need to check how direct velocities for pan and zoom fit in with this integration.
**Analyzing implementation issues**

I've noticed that 'Direct velocities' assignments occur after the yaw and pitch switches, but I'm not sure if the 'Pan FSM desired toggles' and 'Zoom FSM desired toggle' come after those assignments. We inserted 'Pitch FSM overrides' before 'Direct velocities', but it's unclear if pan and zoom toggles were added correctly. 

We didn't reassign 'targetPanXVel', 'targetPanYVel', or 'targetZoomVel', which could be affecting performance. Also, I'm concerned about negative signs in 'targetPitchVel.' The user pointed out potential assignment issues, especially related to their request for a careful comparison of Yaw's implementation with other variables. I need to dig deeper!
**Reviewing integration logic**

I need to double-check the order of 'stepSpin' to see if I properly inserted the pan and zoom toggles before the auto pan early reversal code. The toggles should appear before 'Direct velocities', but I didn't find them in the previous snippets. 

Since the default pan speed is 0, it means there won't be any movement unless the user adjusts the pan speed slider. On the other hand, it seems the yaw operates independently and might be functioning correctly despite at a default speed of 0. It could be a matter of UI logic impacting speed settings between yaw and pan.
**Reflecting on variable toggles**

I need to focus on the mirror yaw settings and the toggles for increasing and decreasing other variables. We’ve added start/resume toggles, but perhaps not enough for per-run toggles. I’ll grep for yaw’s structure and see if the pitch and pan toggles were incorporated properly.

It’s possible the lack of pan toggles ahead of 'Direct velocities' could be causing issues, especially if they haven’t been assigned correctly. Also, it seems like the user’s report of “not working properly” might stem from unexpected behavior when toggled settings are engaged. Time to double-check the assignments to ensure everything aligns!
**Addressing variable mismatches**

I need to be careful about the changes we made to 'targetPitchVel' and 'targetYawVel.' It looks like we didn’t change 'const' for yaw while we mutated 'targetYawVel.' The user wants a comparison of yaw with other variables, focusing on identifying issues rather than just stating changes we've made.

I'll create a bullet-list summary of mismatches and corrections, covering missing toggles for pan and zoom. We need to implement the missing pan FSM desired toggles before 'Direct velocities.' It’s clear we must remove duplication in zoom toggles to keep everything running smoothly. Let's patch this properly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging variable comparisons**

I need to respond concisely while also doing debugging and careful comparison. The user has asked me to compare Yaw easing, which works perfectly, to the other variables, focusing on mirroring the code from Yaw to pitch, pan, and zoom. We’ve made changes, but they still aren’t functioning properly, so it’s crucial to examine the app-module.js structure for inconsistencies. I should read the relevant code carefully and ensure all state transitions in the FSMs are set up correctly.
**Checking toggles for pitch and pan**

I’m wondering if we have a UI or input toggles to set pitchDesiredRunning to false. The user didn’t specifically ask for toggles, which is fine, but I still need to ensure that the early reversal for pitch direction is set properly. We have the code using pitchState for that. Now I should check pan and zoom; I see we’ve added the necessary toggles and states. It’s important to verify if we added the desired running toggles in the right place during stepSpin.
**Reviewing pan integration logic**

I'm reviewing the grep results for 'ePanX_IncreaseVelToSteadyState' found around line 992 in the start/resume areas. It seems like stepSpin has sections for "Early pan reversal" and "Integrate pan," where we added logic for decrease and increase states. However, I need to check if we set these states based on panXDesiredRunning toggles. The grep results also show some activity around editing pitch toggles, but I'm unsure about pan. It looks like the toggles weren't included in stepSpin, as searching didn’t return any matches.
**Examining velocity handling**

I see that in earlier modifications, we had set panXDesiredRunning to true and adjusted the states from zero to increase/steady. However, if there were no toggles at runtime, it might stay in steady. With early reversal, that seems fine, but we might not have properly handled decreases to zero for pan and zoom when toggles are false, even though the user hasn’t toggled them. It's still not working right, and I notice another mismatch in how we handle velocities. For yaw, we override "Direct velocities" and set curYawVel to targetYawVel. We also set curPitchVel based on the state, yet it seems we haven’t incorporated any alpha factor smoothing for pitch, pan, or zoom.
**Analyzing early reversal and toggles**

I'm noticing some mismatches in how early reversals work for yaw, pitch, and pan. For yaw, we use "shortestAngleDiff," while pitch uses a similar boundary for early reversal, based on 'basePol.' The issue is that we might not be handling decreases to zero properly for pan/zoom when toggles are false. I also see we've set 'targetPitchVel' as 'let,' but did we apply similar logic for 'targetPanXVel' and 'targetZoomVel'? Additionally, our pan speed defaults are set incorrectly, potentially affecting the user experience. 

Overall, we should closely compare the FSM behaviors of yaw, pitch, and pan to ensure everything is functioning as intended.
**Examining integration and states**

I want to search for references to 'Pan FSM overrides' or 'panXDesiredRunning' within stepSpin, as there are existing assignments in start/resume. However, the toggles from desired states seem absent; I found early reversal checks but need pan toggles incorporated. We’ve successfully implemented zoom toggles and a related integration state.

There's a potential issue about how we calculate the zoom distance using the old 'tmpOffset' before updating it after applying modifications. I also notice that smoothing is removed in favor of direct assignments in the FSM, which could be relevant to the user's reported issues. I need to compare yaw with pitch/pan/zoom behaviors more closely to ensure everything is functioning as intended.
**Evaluating zoom and pan functionality**

I’m focusing on the code around line 1993 where we inserted the Zoom FSM desired toggles before the "Auto zoom with early reversal." The pan integration currently includes states for decrease, increase, and reversal, which aligns with yaw functionality. 

I suspect some issues might arise from how we manage velocity variables; they should behave similarly, but the “still not working properly” comment suggests that could be due to typos. 

We need to ensure that default speeds are set correctly, as it seems that if they default to zero, they won't operate as intended. So, I should verify the default settings in the UI and how those interact with the overall system behavior to resolve inconsistencies.
**Addressing yaw and pan mismatches**

I’m thinking about how yaw works when the user mentioned it operates during startup and mouse release. I should investigate possible reasons for yaw's functionality and the mismatches remaining. 

It seems like yaw has some overrides, while others don’t, indicating we might need to disable smoothing elsewhere. We need to get toggles for pan in place since they’re currently missing, and I suspect that could lead to independent behavior issues. 

I’ll prioritize adding pan toggles near the existing logic for pitch before direct velocities to ensure everything functions correctly together.
**Fixing zoom and pan toggles**

I need to prioritize adding zoom toggles to the right place, as I initially inserted them too late, after the direct velocities. It's crucial to have them set before computing `curZoomVel` to ensure correct functionality. 

It seems logical to place zoom and pan toggles together before `Direct velocities`, mirroring the order we've established for yaw and pitch toggles. My plan is to patch the code to insert the toggles in the correct sequence while removing any duplicate lines from earlier attempts. I'll check the exact content of the zoom toggle block to ensure proper adjustments.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging logic issues**

I changed targetPitchVel to let and ensured there are no lints, but "still not working properly" means the logic must be off somewhere. I need to compare the yaw sections and check for any differences. Yaw toggling semantics seem important; yaw uses yawDesiredRunning toggled by the 'y' key, while the others default to true, which we didn't provide UI toggles for. Lastly, I need to verify how I’m handling velocities for pitch to make sure everything aligns correctly.
**Ensuring state transitions**

I need to focus on bounce and reversal semantics. Yaw has an early reversal near yawLimit, and I've kept those for pitch as well. For pan X and Y, I'm checking the distance to the limit, while zoom uses min/max settings. The default toggle for pan and zoom is true, and I’ve set desired toggles at the start to maintain a steady state. However, I need to verify if initial states and transitions like 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero' to 'IncreaseVelToSteadyState' have been properly implemented in my code.
**Reviewing code placements**

In stepSpin, I inserted "Pan FSM desired toggles" earlier, but I need to double-check the file where those were added. In the read_file snippet, I put pitch overrides and switches right before "Direct velocities." I also want to confirm if I placed the panXDesiredRunning toggles correctly. Did I really insert the "Pan FSM desired toggles" before "Direct velocities"? Looking around line 1918, I see processes for integrating pan and need to validate where exactly those toggles fit in relation to 'Direct velocities.'
**Confirming code logic and presence**

The grep results indicate many lines referencing 'ePanX_IncreaseVelToSteadyState.' However, I didn’t find 'Pan FSM desired toggles' because we just included the logic, not the comment text. To confirm, it looks like the code "this.spin.panXState === 'ePanX_SteadyStateZero'" is present in specific states during start/resume and runtime integration for 'ReverseDirection.' I didn’t find the desired toggles near 'Direct velocities,' so I’ll search for the z-run toggles for pan and check occurrences of "panXStartSign = 0."</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring yaw functionality**

Hmm, it seems like yaw is working fine for the user, and they mentioned it functions properly. Maybe the change we made to set the yaw speed through the slider adjustment is making a difference. I wonder if there's some additional hooking involved that applies the default slider value by checking the current input value. I think I should look into the UI initialization code to find where it reads the slider input value initially.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating yaw's structure**

I need to analyze the structure of yaw in stepSpin. Basically, I’m computing the alpha (ease factor), but I’ve forced yaw’s alpha to 1, which means there's no low-pass smoothing. Instead, easing happens through a finite state machine with constant acceleration to adjust velocities.

Next, I determine the yawDesiredRunning, toggled by the 'Y' key. Upon startup, I set it to true and transition yawState accordingly, calculating velocity changes based on the current state.
**Analyzing yawState transitions**

I’m examining how to switch the yawState. 

For eYaw_SteadyStateVel, I set yawTransitionVel to targetYawVel, which seems good. In eYaw_SteadyStateZero, I set both targetYawVel and yawTransitionVel to zero.

For eYaw_DecreaseVelToZero, I integrate yawTransitionVel and update yawStartSign when necessary. 

In eYaw_IncreaseVelToSteadyState, I do something similar but need to change the sign when I reach the desired state. 

Lastly, eYaw_ReverseDirection handles early reversals near the boundary, recalculating yawTransitionVel until it matches the desired state. Then I update curYawVel accordingly for the corresponding pitch, pan, and zoom transitions.
**Addressing early reversals**

I’m focusing on the logic for early yaw reversal. First, I compute the boundary; if easeSec is greater than 0, I calculate aMag based on the current yaw velocity. If the distance to the boundary is less than or equal to the stopping distance, I set yawState to eYaw_ReverseDirection and adjust yawA accordingly. 

Pitch has similar logic. For auto pan, it follows the same early reversal principles for X and Y directions, including new integration states like ePanX_DecreaseVelToZero. I want to ensure we have triggers for starting and stopping, with desiredRunning flags set to true during startup and resume, but I can't find any other toggles anywhere.
**Examining yaw toggles and integration**

The yaw toggles can be activated with the 'y' key, but we didn't implement UI toggles for the other elements, as the goal is to mirror yaw's behavior and keep everything running. I set yawDesiredRunning to true upon immediate start and resuming, with resets for the other states.

A key difference is that yaw uses "targetYawVel" based on direction and speed. For pitch, we added similar logic, but for pan and zoom, we included desired toggles and integrated them into the system. I realize we've added pan desired toggles a bit later and included updates in stepSpin for behavior adjustments based on their states.
**Analyzing integration and mismatches**

I’m digging into the toggles and integration states we worked on for yaw, pitch, pan, and zoom. After checking the pan desired toggles, I noticed they might not have been properly integrated. The yaw logic for early reversal works well, but pitch, pan, and zoom still use separate conditions without a unified "switch" for curVel adjustment.

The current code doesn't fully utilize alpha smoothing for these axes, which is a potential mismatch. Additionally, there are differences in how we handle early reversals and boundary conditions compared to yaw. I’m realizing we need to reconcile these aspects to ensure everything operates correctly.
**Investigating speed settings and UI alignment**

I’m considering how yawSpeed set to 0 degrees per second means nothing would move, even if the code allows acceleration to zero. They mentioned yaw works, possibly because the yaw speed slider in the UI is adjusted. 

The other axes might not be moving due to their defaults being 0. I see that the pitch-speed and yaw-speed default values in the HTML differ from the code defaults. I need to check the UI initialization and see how the UIController applies these states and whether it correctly updates the app's spin settings. I'm planning to explore the "applyStateToApp()" method for clarity.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Yaw Easing**

I need to carefully compare Yaw easing with other variables because the user says it's still not working. We added code to mirror yaw for pitch, pan, and zoom, but I shouldn’t just fix this blindly. I must ensure I follow the developer instructions, particularly regarding status updates when using tools. Now, I need to analyze the code deeply to identify and address any mismatches between the Yaw implementation and the others.
**Reviewing Yaw Mechanics**

I’m examining the yaw mechanics, including the spin initial fields like yawState. During initialization, we set the desired yaw and compute easing to the desired speed if in the zero state. When controls are resumed, we accelerate the yaw again. In the stepSpin process, I compute target velocities and implement a yaw finite state machine. I also need to manage state transitions, integration of angles, and early yaw reversal detection. Yaw toggling is controlled by the 'y' key, which isn’t used for other functions.
**Assessing Other Variables**

Now, I'm looking at other variables like pitchStartSign, panX/Y start signs, and zoomStartSign. Upon initialization, we mirrored the start for pitch, panX/Y, and zoom, repeating this on control end. In the stepSpin process, I’ve implemented pitch FSM toggles to check pitchDesiredRunning and adjust targetPitchVel accordingly. 

For pan, there are toggles for desired velocities, but I noticed we didn't incorporate early reversal logic fully. There's existing logic for reversing directions. Lastly, I need to address a mismatch regarding yaw disabling exponential alpha smoothing with the alphaYaw variable.
**Evaluating Yaw Easing Logic**

I see there's a note about temporarily disabling easing for yaw by setting alphaYaw to 1. However, the smoothing for yaw has been removed; we just kept the general alpha variable that's computed but not used for yaw. For pitch and other variables, we assign direct velocities, so smoothing isn't applied there either—good to note. 

But I’m wondering if there’s still an error with assigning constant variables. We changed targetPitchVel to let, yet I need to check for potential errors with pan and zoom as well. It seems targetPanXVel might not be reassigned properly, especially since we’re using integrated panXTransitionVel.
**Identifying Variable Mismatches**

I'm examining curPanXVel setup, where it currently derives from other states. After adding the "IncreaseVelToSteadyState" and "DecreaseVelToZero" states, I'm realizing these aren’t factored into the conditions, so it defaults to transitionVel. I need to confirm where targetPanXVel is getting reassigned since we haven’t made changes for it but have for pitch and yaw. 

Additionally, there are concerns about variable signs for speed, especially since the default speeds are set to zero for yaw and pan, which might explain why they're not moving. The code also addresses early reversals, which could be contributing to conflicts. It seems additional mismatches show potential integration issues as well, especially between direct velocities and transition states. I'm really digging into this to figure out the inconsistencies!
**Addressing Yaw and Variable Integration**

I’m analyzing how yaw functions and its limit triggers, particularly with speed conditions. It seems yaw doesn't rotate until prompted by another action because it’s set to zero, which is interesting given the user notes that it works. They want me to compare yaw with other variables to ensure structural consistency.

Yaw has unique toggles and variables not mirrored in others, and I've found that while pitch integrates well, pan and zoom lack desired toggles in the stepSpin section. I realize there's a need to successfully incorporate these toggles to ensure all components work similarly. I will need to review and implement the necessary integration for pan and zoom to align with yaw’s functionality.
**Implementing Code Patches for Toggles**

I need to find a safe spot to insert pan and zoom toggles in the code, ideally after the yaw switch-case and before the direct velocities assignment, which starts at line 1826. Therefore, I'll place the new pan toggles before this line, modifying the structure accordingly.

There's also a concern about existing zoom toggles being added too late, after direct velocity assignments. To ensure proper functionality, I’ll reposition the zoom toggles earlier too. It's important we keep everything consistent to avoid conflicts. 

Finally, I'll prepare a patch that reflects these changes and ensure that existing code remains clean while mirroring the required functionality effectively.
**Inserting and Patching Code for Toggles**

I need to add code for pan and zoom desired toggles to mirror yaw. I’ll structure this properly to check if the pan is desired running and adjust the state accordingly. Once this is set, I’ll create a patch to eliminate the later block of code that duplicates the toggle logic.

I must verify that there aren’t any leftover const assignments, particularly for targetPanX and targetPanY, and look for any typos as we prepare the final patch. I have to remind myself to update the TODO list with a status update before moving forward!</details></think>

---

I found that the zoom desired-toggle logic was placed after the direct velocity assignment, unlike Yaw which processes toggles before velocities. I’ll move the Zoom toggle earlier and also add missing Pan X/Y desired-toggle FSM blocks before the velocity assignment to exactly mirror Yaw. Then I’ll lint.

---



---



---

Status: I compared Yaw vs others inside stepSpin and found Pan/Zoom toggles were applied after velocity assignment. I moved Pan X/Y and Zoom desired-toggle FSM blocks to mirror Yaw, before velocities are computed. I also ensured Pitch’s target is mutable and its states mirror Yaw’s.

Please retry:
- Increase `pitch-speed`, `pan-x-speed`, `pan-y-speed`, `zoom-speed` from 0 to non-zero.
- Drag and release: all should smoothly accelerate to steady, reverse with easing near limits, and resume after mouse release, like Yaw.

- Key edits:
  - Declared `targetPitchVel` as let to allow reassignment.
  - Added/relocated FSM desired-running toggles for Pitch, Pan X/Y, Zoom before direct velocity assignment.
  - Implemented Increase/Decrease transitions and reverse handling symmetrically.
