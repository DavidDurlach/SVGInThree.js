# Debugging pitch animation direction issue (2025-09-09 09:37Z)

_**User**_

I am having an odd problem with Pitch (the only variable fully up to date in terms of its logic) where, if I drag-release with the mouse, just past (outside) the limit 
  point, the graph heads in the correct direction (back to within the animation limit from outside it), but then reverse direction almost immediately after 
  it passes the limit, hard-bounces off the limit on the proper side, and then continues properly. The log data that I have from that run is
   below.
--------
   [PITCH] step=0.000825 cur=0.049706 tgt=3.490659 dCur=0.000000 dt=0.0166 alpha=0.0327 dir=-1 paused=1

----------------------------------
The issue is that when returning into the allowed animation range from outside it, the direction should not actually/visibly switch until we are near the *other* side of the range.  Now, with high velocity, it may be that as soon as we enter the allowed animation range, we want to enter the reverse direction state because it takes the full animation range to affect that change, but regardless, we should never *actually/visually* switch direction back towards the limit we were outside of until after getting to other "far" limit.  Before you make any code changes, can you examine the code, and log above, and comment.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching code logic**

I'm planning to search for "PITCH" in the code and logs to understand the logic better. The developer guidelines suggest using codebase_search, but I can also use grep for specific terms. I’ll start by using functions.grep to search for variations of "[PITCH" and "Pitch." Then, I want to open the js/app-module.js file, which has 3318 lines. Even though it's large, the tool can handle it. Additionally, I'll search for relevant logs and functions related to animation boundaries. We need to include a status update before any tool calls.
**Reading and parsing files**

I’m going to read the entire js/app-module.js and then parse it. According to the 'status_update_spec', I need to post a brief progress update before making any tool calls, so I'll be sure to do that. The user wants analysis and comments, not a todo list, so I’ll skip creating one for now. I plan to read both app-module.js and index.html quickly by running multi_tool_use.parallel to fetch both files at once. After that, I'll search for the "Pitch" variable visually, and run a grep search for "[PITCH" logs later.
**Executing simultaneous calls**

I want to optimize the process by running three parallel calls: I’ll read the js file, read index.html, and grep for "\[PITCH" in the js file all at once. This way, I can gather the information more efficiently. Paralleling these tasks should save time and help me get the insights faster! It makes sense to handle them together rather than sequentially, so let’s proceed with this approach.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the relevant source files and locate the PITCH logging/animation code to understand the state transitions and why direction flips occur near the boundary. Then I'll review the log you shared against the code’s logic to pinpoint the likely cause.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing pitch handling code**

I need to analyze the code for pitch handling. The grep tool didn't work due to rg not being present, so I'll use read_file with an offset to check lines around 2406, as indicated by the log. I'll scan parts of app-module.js, which has quite a lot of tokens. I think reading around lines 2390-2450 should help me get the relevant PITCH logging lines and functions. The user wants an analysis first, so I won't make any code changes yet.
**Reviewing accessible files for pitch code**

The user’s rules state that I should review all accessible files before replying, but reading an entire large file isn't realistic. However, I should search for code related to "PITCH." Since grep isn't an option, I can scan segments for "PITCH" strings instead. To do this, I can read the file in chunks using read_file with an offset. I think it makes sense to focus on lines around 2350-2460, starting at an offset of 2350 with a limit of 200.</details></think>

I'll open the relevant region of `js/app-module.js` around the line numbers referenced in your logs to locate the PITCH update and logging logic, so I can compare the code paths to the behavior you observed.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing pitch behavior**

I need to analyze behavior based on the logs the user provided, specifically around app-module.js:2397. First, I’ll investigate the PITCH update logic and how animation boundaries are set. There seem to be some logging code in read_file, but to understand why the direction flips near the boundary, I need to check how pitch direction and limits are managed in the `spin` object and the state machine `pitchState`. 

Since the grep tool failed, I'll read the entire file in segments using read_file, focusing on specific function definitions related to pitch logic. The logging section is in the 2350-2518 range, and I want to look into the animate function more earlier in the file.
**Locating spin object definitions**

I need to locate the definitions and functions related to the spin object for the pitch update, which I suspect are near `class App`. To gather this information, I'll focus on reading the earlier lines, specifically between 1400 and 2400, to capture the animate update. I can use the read_file function with an offset of 1700 and set a limit of 800 lines. This method should help me find the information I need efficiently.</details></think>

I'm going to open more of `js/app-module.js` around the animation loop and spin logic to find where pitch direction, limits, and state transitions are handled, so I can map the logs to the code path.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing code logic and logs**

I need to take a closer look at the user's code in `app-module.js`, specifically focusing on the PITCH logic and the provided log lines. The user requested an examination without any code changes, just analysis. It's important to ensure that I include a status update when making tool calls. I noticed that the previous assistant didn't include a status update before the first tool call, which might be a point to address. Overall, I think we're on the right track.
**Explaining pitch direction flip**

I need to analyze the code to understand why the pitch direction flips near the boundary, resulting in a "hard-bounce" and immediate reversal behavior. I'll start by examining relevant functions like stepSpin, which integrates various velocities and uses finite-state machines. For yaw, there's reversal logic that aims to force it toward the center, while the pitch direction depends on the difference from a base value. It seems counterintuitive that yaw and pitch use different rules, but the target pitch velocity complicates things. I need to clarify these mechanisms.
**Analyzing velocity direction and pitch behavior**

I’m examining how the direction of velocity relates to pitchDir. If pitchDir is set to the sign of dPol, then the target velocity becomes negative pitchDir times speed, which should move dPol toward zero—this makes sense. The out-of-bounds code correctly points the velocity toward the center. Inside the block, different states handle boundary hits appropriately, like reversing velocity when limits are hit in specific states. I see how it aims to manage pitch transitions effectively!
**Reviewing pitch state transitions**

I'm analyzing the behavior when within bounds and the state is 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel'. Here, I need to compute the stop distance and trigger early reversal if the movement passes the braking point. The code sets the state to 'ReverseDirection', determines acceleration based on various factors, and flips pitchDir. I see that direct velocities, which are managed by the finite state machine (FSM), utilize targetPitchVel for curPitchVel, meaning that the 'ReverseDirection' state relies on pitchTransitionVel as the target. This is a critical link!
**Investigating pitch velocity behavior**

I'm analyzing how pitch velocity behaves during boundary transitions. It seems like while in 'SteadyStateVel', pitchTransitionVel is set to targetPitchVel, which determines curPitchVel based on state logic. The logs reveal unexpected changes, where curPitchVel goes negative while target remains positive. This inconsistency could stem from how targetPitchVel and pitchTransitionVel are assigned and updated. 

Moreover, when crossing back within bounds, the expected early reversal doesn’t trigger because the signs of dPol and curPitchVel suggest it's moving toward the center. I need to identify how this momentary reversal occurs after crossing the limit.
**Clarifying pitch velocity transitions**

I'm going through the pitch velocity logic and how it behaves near boundaries. When computing 'stopDist', it relies on the current curPitchVel, but the direction might have changed earlier due to the out-of-bounds checks. 

As we cross back within bounds, the 'isMovingAway' condition suggests that if dPol and curPitchVel have the same sign, we might see unexpected behavior. The logs indicate that 'curPitchVel' can briefly become positive while 'targetPitchVel' is negative, which could cause the reversal effect witnessed. There seems to be a mismatch in how velocities and directions are being calculated during transitions, especially across state changes.
**Analyzing pitch direction and behavior**

I’m exploring the relationship between pitch velocity, direction, and state changes. When transitioning states, the acceleration 'pitchA' might flip signs unexpectedly. For instance, if 'signCur' is negative, then 'pitchA' becomes positive, potentially increasing 'pitchTransitionVel' towards zero.

As we re-enter bounds, 'isMovingAway' may yield false, but the direction could flip erroneously from prior calculations. I also notice that the logs indicate a mismatch between the current and target pitch velocities during these transitions, leading to confusion about the movement direction and state, especially under conditions labeled 'ReverseDirection'.
**Examining pitch direction changes**

I'm noticing that when 'cur' becomes negative, it suggests that 'targetPitchVel' also changes to negative, indicating a move away from the center. Yet, 'tgt' remains positive, leading to inconsistencies. The logs show that 'curPitchVel' must equal 'targetPitchVel' calculated previously, but their misalignment complicates the analysis.

The code may flip 'pitchDir' upon entering the allowed range. To avoid undesirable direction changes, we shouldn't visually switch directions until after reaching the far limit. This can create unexpected behavior if we enter 'ReverseDirection' prematurely while outside bounds, leading to rapid direction changes.
**Analyzing direction changes in pitch**

I'm trying to sort through how the 'out-of-bounds' block alters 'pitchDir' and 'targetPitchVel.' When dPol is positive, 'pitchDir' is set to 1, but there are inconsistencies since 'curPitchVel' can still be positive while 'targetPitchVel' is negative. 

It seems a sign flip occurs early due to transitioning states, and this mismatch ends up creating an "anti-glitch." I’ve verified that the huge change in 'cur' possibly results from direct assignments in the state management, triggering abrupt reversals that can look visually jarring. 

So, I'm investigating how massive velocity changes occur across frames to resolve these discrepancies.
**Examining pitch acceleration issues**

It seems like 'dCur' is calculated from the difference between the current and previous pitch velocity, which may cause unexpected large values if the sampling interval spans multiple frames. If 'prevPitchVel' is from a sample too long ago (the last debug sample), it could lead to inaccuracies. 

Additionally, rapid changes in 'curPitchVel' when transitioning between states might create visual glitches. These glitches could stem from the combination of small distances to boundaries, causing sudden reversals that flip the pitch direction too quickly. I'm working to dissect the logs to determine the root cause.
**Analyzing pitch direction logic**

It seems there’s a possible issue with how 'pitchDir' behaves around the boundaries during the 'RESUME' phase. Even if 'dPol' shows I'm within limits, it gets tricky because that moment might be captured after crossing boundaries, leading to confusion. 

We need to pinpoint the logic in the relevant section of the code, where 'pitchDir' flips both outside and inside the bounds, potentially causing mismatches in the target and current pitch velocity. This double-flipping effect occurs when deceleration spikes near boundaries, suggesting that implementing fixes related to pitch direction could help stabilize performance.
**Proposing pitch adjustments**

The out-of-bounds logic for pitch currently sets 'pitchDir' while also triggering a reversal, which seems to cause too many flips near the boundary. It’s interesting to note that yaw handles its out-of-bounds setting differently without changing states. To improve this, I propose that pitch should mimic yaw: adjust 'pitchDir' to redirect towards the center without flipping into a 'ReverseDirection' state. It could prevent unnecessary toggles.

Additionally, I think we should compute 'isMovingAway' based on 'targetVel' instead of 'curVel' to minimize inconsistencies. Implementing hysteresis may also help, along with adjustments to logging functionality for clarity.
**Crafting the Commentary**

I found that the log reveals a sudden sign flip of 'cur' after the 'resume' action, suggesting 'ReverseDirection' is activated at the boundary with a significant acceleration. The out-of-bounds logic sets 'pitchDir' to Math.sign(dPol), which likely contributes to a logging mismatch.

To address this, I recommend adjusting how 'target' is computed for logging and proposing algorithm modifications to improve recovery. I'll present my findings with high-level bullet points and code citations to clarify the analysis, focusing on key directional decisions and the early pitch reversal.</details></think>

I inspected the PITCH FSM and the debug logs in your `stepSpin`. The behavior you describe matches how the pitch “early reversal” and “out-of-bounds recovery” currently interact, plus a logging mismatch that makes it look even stranger.

### What the code is doing
- Direct velocity is set from the FSM target each frame, then integrated:
```2078:2087:js/app-module.js
// Direct velocities (FSM-managed; no exponential smoothing)
this.spin.curYawVel = targetYawVel;
this.spin.curPitchVel = targetPitchVel;
this.spin.curPanXVel = targetPanXVel;
this.spin.curPanYVel = targetPanYVel;
this.spin.curZoomVel = targetZoomVel;
// Integrate
s.theta += this.spin.curYawVel * dt;
s.phi += this.spin.curPitchVel * dt;
```

- When pitch is out of bounds, recovery forces the direction toward center and may enter ReverseDirection depending on state:
```2121:2149:js/app-module.js
// Early pitch reversal
let dPol = s.phi - this.spin.basePol;
if (Math.abs(dPol) > this.spin.pitchLimit) {
	// STATE 1: RECOVERY (out of bounds) -> Force direction back toward center
	this.spin.pitchDir = Math.sign(dPol);

	// If reversing/increasing/steady, manipulate reversal state/accel immediately
	if (this.spin.pitchState === 'ePitch_ReverseDirection') {
		this.spin.pitchTransitionVel = -this.spin.pitchDir * this.spin.pitchSpeed;
		this.spin.pitchA = 0;
		this.spin.pitchState = 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel';
	} else if (this.spin.pitchState === 'ePitch_IncreaseVelToSteadyState') {
		...
		this.spin.pitchState = 'ePitch_ReverseDirection';
	} else if (this.spin.pitchState === 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel') {
		...
		this.spin.pitchState = 'ePitch_ReverseDirection';
	}
}
```

- When back inside bounds and in steady state, “early reversal” triggers if moving away from center and within braking distance, which flips `pitchDir` and starts a reversal:
```2152:2190:js/app-module.js
} else if (this.spin.pitchState === 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel') {
	const stopDist = (this.spin.curPitchVel * this.spin.curPitchVel) / (2 * (Math.abs(this.spin.curPitchVel) / (easeSec > 0 ? easeSec : 1e-3)) + PITCH_EPS_VEL);
	const triggerOffset = this.spin.pitchLimit - stopDist;
	const isMovingAway = this.spin.curPitchVel !== 0 && Math.sign(dPol) === Math.sign(this.spin.curPitchVel);
	if (isMovingAway && Math.abs(dPol) >= triggerOffset - PITCH_EPS_ANG) {
		this.spin.pitchState = 'ePitch_ReverseDirection';
		const signCur = Math.sign(this.spin.curPitchVel || this.spin.pitchDir || 1);
		...
		this.spin.pitchDir *= -1;
	}
}
```

- The debug “tgt” you log is recomputed every frame as “-dir * speed”, not the actual target used by the FSM in reversal states, so it can disagree with “cur”:
```2394:2401:js/app-module.js
// PITCH LOG
const dPol = tmpSpherical.phi - this.spin.basePol;
const computedDirPitch = -Math.sign(dPol);
console.log(`[PITCH RESUME] ... cur=${this.spin.curPitchVel.toFixed(6)} tgt=${targetPitchVel.toFixed(6)} dir=${this.spin.pitchDir} ...`);
```

### Why you see the flip just after re-entering the range
- Right after you re-enter the allowed range, the code can very quickly switch into and out of `ePitch_ReverseDirection` due to two factors:
  - While out-of-bounds, it may already put the FSM into `ReverseDirection` (not just set `pitchDir`). That can abruptly change `curPitchVel` by using a large deceleration magnitude.
  - Inside bounds, the “early reversal” test uses `curPitchVel` and a distance-based accel term that can spike when you’re just inside the limit (small distance to boundary). With high speed, `distBasedAMag` becomes large, so the reversal can flip the sign of `curPitchVel` in one frame, making you appear to head back to the boundary you just crossed.
- Then, because `pitchDir` is flipped inside that block, and `curPitchVel` is evolving under the reversal’s acceleration, the logic immediately realizes you’re “moving away” from the opposite side and bounces again, creating the “hard-bounce then continue properly” you’re seeing.
- The log accentuates confusion because “tgt” is logged as `-dir*speed`, while in `ReverseDirection` the actual target used for integration is `pitchTransitionVel`. So you get lines like “cur negative, tgt positive” even though the FSM is driving `cur` via the transition velocity.

### Concrete evidence in your log
- Immediate large sign change of “cur” while “dir” still unchanged:
  - From cur=+3.374769 to cur=-2.443461 in one 16 ms step indicates the reversal state applied a big decel (or distance-based accel) right at/after re-entry.
- Rapid `dir` flips and cur sign toggles in the next few frames show the “in-bounds early reversal” ping-pong due to tiny distance-to-boundary and high speed.

### Notes on correctness vs intent
- Yaw’s out-of-bounds handling only adjusts `yawDir` and lets the in-bounds logic perform the bounce; pitch additionally manipulates state/accel while out-of-bounds. This asymmetry likely contributes to the visible flip as you re-enter.

### Suggestions (no code changes yet)
- Consider removing reversal state transitions from the out-of-bounds branch for pitch, mirroring yaw: when out-of-bounds, only force `pitchDir` toward center; let reversal planning happen only once safely in-bounds.
- Add hysteresis for direction flips when just re-entering: e.g., disallow flipping `pitchDir` until you’ve traveled a minimum interior angle or time, or until you cross the center. This avoids immediate post-entry “ping-pong.”
- Compute “isMovingAway” against the velocity actually used for integration in this state (transition velocity) or consistently log the true applied target to reduce diagnostic ambiguity.
- Cap or soften the distance-based acceleration when very close to the boundary (avoid “infinite” a = v^2/(2d) spikes as d→0).

If you want, I can prototype a minimal change that mirrors yaw in the pitch out-of-bounds branch and adds a small hysteresis window to eliminate the visible reversal right after re-entry.

_**User**_

Questions regarding your Suggestions:

1) I want to start with fixes that ignore smoothness, and instead focus on core logic — such as hard-preventing direction changes that should never happen.  We can then tackle smoothness 2nd.

2) Do you think more than one of your methods will be required in combination, or it is likely a single proper fix will be sufficient?

3) I very much want to do things in the smallest possible steps possible, so I can test in between.

4) If Yaw appears cleaner/better in how it handles outside>inside allowed range (and it does so to me — do you agree?), I would tend to want to start simply by mirroring the Yaw structure to Pitch in that regard and see how it performs.  Do you agree that would be a good first step?

5) Overall, could you respond to all the above points, and other areas of concern you have, to suggest a path forward.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning user response**

I need to focus on answering the user's questions without making any code changes just yet. They want me to examine the code and the log, which I've already done, and now they’re asking for concise responses on five specific points while proposing a path forward. Since this is a read-only discussion, I think we might not need a to-do list right now. I’ll structure my responses clearly with markdown headings and bullet points, ensuring I keep it skimmable and straightforward.
**Confirming yaw adjustments**

I believe we need to confirm that yaw appears cleaner. As a minimal step, I recommend mirroring the out-of-bounds handling for pitch. This means making it so out-of-bounds only sets direction and doesn’t change state or acceleration. Also, we should disable reversal triggers briefly for a "re-entry guard." Since the user wants the smallest step to test, I suggest starting with just the mirroring. If that doesn’t fix everything, we can adjust conditions based on transition velocity or consider additional steps like adding hysteresis and improving logging clarity.
**Confirming fixes for pitch handling**

I think a single fix could work: we can avoid entering ReverseDirection when pitch is out-of-bounds, which might help eliminate immediate flipping on re-entry. I’ll break this down point by point: 

1) We should focus on preventing direction flips near boundaries by ensuring `pitchDir` doesn’t flip when just re-entered; it should only point back to the center. 
2) This single fix likely suffices, but if not, we can add small hysteresis and probably won't need more than two adjustments. 
3) I propose a three-step incremental sequence with checks in between. 
4) I agree that yaw is cleaner now; mirroring the yaw logic is a good starting step, but we need to remove manipulations of `pitchState` and `pitchA` and just set `pitchDir` appropriately.
**Ensuring direction sign conventions**

I need to ensure that the direction sign conventions are clear. In the earlier code, `targetPitchVel` is set to `-pitchDir * pitchSpeed`. Since we want to move toward the center when out-of-bounds, if `dPol` is positive, `curPitchVel` needs to be negative, making `-pitchDir * pitchSpeed` negative, which implies `pitchDir` should be positive. This aligns with setting `pitchDir` as `Math.sign(dPol)`.

For yaw, we set `yawDir` to `-sign(dAz)` because `targetYawVel` is positive with no negative sign needed. I suggest modifying the out-of-bounds branch to only set `pitchDir` and remove any state transitions to keep things minimal.
**Path forward steps**

Step 1: For yaw, mirror the pitch logic by only adjusting direction back to center without modifying `pitchState`, `pitchA`, or `pitchTransitionVel`. Test this first.

Step 2: If there's still flipping near the boundary, implement a small re-entry hysteresis that maintains `pitchLastReentryTime` to block early reversals until a certain distance or time is traveled.

Step 3: Limit distance-based acceleration near boundaries by clamping `distBasedAMag` and ensuring we don’t overshoot unrealistic deceleration.

Step 4: Improve logging for clarity, including `pitchState`, `pitchTransitionVel`, and the current bounds state.

I hope this concise response helps guide our next steps efficiently!
**Addressing edge cases and testing steps**

I see that we need to ease disabled and handle edge cases carefully. The code uses a fallback for `easeSec` when near zero, and removing out-of-bounds will still be fine. 

For testing, I suggest we reproduce drag-release interactions near the boundary and inspect the logs to ensure that "ReverseDirection" isn’t triggered prematurely when out-of-bounds. We should also check that the current direction remains stable until crossing the other limit and look for any stutter.

If there are still flips, we'll proceed to the next steps. A brief summary of the plan follows, without a to-do list since this is just planning for now.</details></think>

---

- 1) Yes. We can “hard-prevent” the unwanted visual flip first, and defer smoothness.
- 2) Likely one fix will do: stop pitch from initiating reversal while out-of-bounds. If anything remains, add a tiny hysteresis. Usually these two together are sufficient.
- 3) Agreed. We’ll change one small thing, test, then proceed if needed.
- 4) Yes, yaw’s out→in handling is cleaner. Mirroring that for pitch (only force direction, don’t touch state/accel while out-of-bounds) is the best first step.

### Recommended path (smallest steps, test between)
- Step 1 (minimal, logic-only): In pitch out-of-bounds handling, do exactly what yaw does:
  - Keep `this.spin.pitchDir = Math.sign(dPol)` to point back toward center.
  - Remove out-of-bounds transitions that set `ePitch_ReverseDirection`, mutate `pitchA`, or snap `pitchTransitionVel`. Let reversal decisions happen only once safely inside bounds (as yaw does).
  - Test. This should remove the immediate post-entry flip you’re seeing.
- Step 2 (only if needed): Add a tiny “re-entry hysteresis” for early reversal when just back inside the limit:
  - Gate the “isMovingAway” reversal trigger until we’ve moved at least a small interior angle (e.g., 5–10% of `pitchLimit`) or a short time window (e.g., 150–250 ms). Test again.
- Step 3 (only if still needed): Cap the distance-based acceleration near the boundary so a = v²/(2d) doesn’t spike as d→0, which can cause instantaneous sign flips. Use a reasonable `maxA` clamp or blend with the time-based acceleration.
- Step 4 (diagnostic clarity, optional): Log the applied values during reversal:
  - Include `pitchState`, `pitchTransitionVel`, `pitchA`, and whether we’re out/in bounds with `dPol` vs limit.
  - The current “tgt” in logs is `-pitchDir*pitchSpeed`, which can disagree with the actual integration target in reversal states (the FSM uses `pitchTransitionVel`); showing both eliminates confusion.

Additional note
- Yaw vs Pitch: yaw’s out-of-bounds branch only adjusts `yawDir`; pitch additionally manipulates state/accel while out-of-bounds. Removing those pitch-side state changes aligns behavior and should address the early flip you observed.

Summary
- Start by mirroring yaw’s out-of-bounds behavior for pitch (single small edit). Test.
- If any residual early flip remains, add a small hysteresis. Test.
- Only then consider clamping the distance-based accel and improving logs.

_**User**_

Thank you.  Requests:
A) Could you please implement "Step 4 (diagnostic clarity, optional): Log the applied values during reversal:" items so we can see what is going on.
B) Could you then implement "Start by mirroring yaw’s out-of-bounds behavior for pitch (single small edit)."
C) I will then test and report back (with log data if still not working).

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refining transition logic**

I see that both semantics match: yaw uses -Math.sign, while pitch uses +Math.sign because of the negative sign in the target formula. Now for Step B, I need to remove the "Handle boundary hit based on current state" transitions inside the OOB branch for pitch. This means deleting lines 2127 to 2151, which include the else if and else blocks for setting states. I’ll keep the direction change, edit debug logs for extra info, and ensure we maintain the early reversal behavior.
**Identifying duplicate log lines**

I'm noticing that there are both PITCH RESUME log lines from 2395-2401 and standard PITCH log lines from 2405-2409. Additionally, I found a copied segment starting at offset 2350. There's also a repeated debug code block spanning from 2341 to 2434. It looks like there are two copies of the logging block: one starting around 2363-2429 in the second read and another earlier at 2350. So, I see two code segments with duplicated debug blocks across files.
**Analyzing the animate() function**

I noticed that the animate() function appears to have been read twice. The first block ranges from 2334-2434, and the earlier block starts around 2350 with "Update running values display" and includes debug lines from 2367-2427. After line 2410, they continue. It seems I might be seeing duplicates due to reading the same sections twice, but we need to ensure we're only editing the correct lines.

I'll add diagnostic logging for pitch reversal (state, transition velocity, acceleration, in/out of bounds) and then simplify the pitch out-of-bounds behavior to only set direction, mirroring yaw. I'll make minimal edits and keep formatting intact.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing diagnostic logging**

I need to focus on incorporating diagnostic logging for pitch reversal, tracking specific parameters like pitchState, pitchTransitionVel, pitchA, and whether they’re in or out of bounds. It's crucial to log when reversals start, are ongoing, and when out-of-bounds recovery happens. Existing logs need enhancements to avoid excessive spamming — perhaps limiting logs to when entering a reversal. I’ll also compute dPol and include the "inBounds" status along with actual applied values for better integration.
**Refining logging details**

I realize the logs currently show "tgt" as targetPitchVel, which is calculated as -pitchDir times pitchSpeed. However, after switching, targetPitchVel might get overwritten by transition vel. Earlier logs recompute targetPitchVel as this.spin.pitchDir times speed, which isn’t truly reflective of the final target. To improve diagnostics, I could log both "tgtFSM" and "tgtNominal" or simply log 'appliedTarget' as this.spin.curPitchVel. I'll also modify the logging to incorporate values like 'pitchState', 'pitchTransitionVel', 'pitchA', 'dPol', and more for clarity.
**Enhancing log clarity**

I’m thinking about adding logs for specific transitions like 'ePitch_ReverseDirection', 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel', and others. Since the main request is to log applied values during reversals, I’ll include logs in the 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' case in the switch statement and in the out-of-bounds branch, marking it as "RECOVERY". I’ll also log "PITCH REV START" in 'ePitch_SteadyStateVel' when a reversal is triggered, and log "PITCH OOB" for out-of-bounds states. It seems we should just log each sample in the debug section during reversals while updating the standard PITCH log with additional fields.
**Adding diagnostic logs and mirroring yaw**

I’m planning to add a new log within the debug block for when spin.pitchState is 'ePitch_ReverseDirection', when dPol exceeds the pitch limit, or when re-entering. I think after the "Standard PITCH log," I'll print a "PITCH DIAG" line with those specific fields, while trying to keep changes minimal. 

Next, for the pitch out-of-bounds handling, I notice that the yaw direction is set to the negative sign of dAz. This means if dAz is positive, yawDir should be negative to return to center. For pitch, the targetPitchVel considers this relationship to align with the three.js coordinate system.
**Implementing code changes**

I’m planning to add two console.log lines: one for when the pitch reversal starts with 'PITCH REV START' and another for when it finishes. 

Next, I’ll modify the out-of-bounds (OOB) branch to mirror the yaw behavior by setting this.spin.pitchDir to Math.sign(dPol) and removing other modifications. I’ll ensure consistency in direction signs: yaw uses a negative sign while pitch retains a positive one. Additionally, I’ll adjust comments to clarify that recovery only sets direction.

I’ll need to add gating for 'PITCH DIAG' logs under DEBUG_SAMPLE_EVERY to avoid clutter, while creating a todo list for tasks. Finally, I’ll prepare to apply these code edits with the correct context.</details></think>

---

I’m going to:
- Add diagnostic pitch logs (state, transition velocity, acceleration, in/out-of-bounds) during reversal and when crossing limits.
- Simplify pitch out-of-bounds handling to only set direction, mirroring yaw.
- Add entry/exit logs for pitch reversal to aid testing.

Proceeding to implement these edits now.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing code changes**

I need to implement the requested code changes using the edit tools. The apply_patch failed because of ordering issues. I'll read the relevant sections again to ensure I'm clear about the context. I've already looked at the block from lines 1500 to 2291, but now I need the specific "Early pitch reversal" block from lines 2121 to 2190. I'll re-open the same range to copy the exact lines, then craft a precise patch while following the tool rules. If apply_patch fails again, I may use edit_file. Additionally, I need to add diagnostic logs for reversal and crossing limits earlier in animations.
**Logging implementation details**

I'm planning to add logs at specific points in the code to track out-of-bounds detection and pitch reversal. First, after setting pitchDir in the early pitch reversal OOB branch, I’ll log the OOB status. Next, when we start the reversal in the in-bounds `isMovingAway` block, I’ll include a log for the start of the pitch reversal. I'll also log when `ePitch_ReverseDirection` is done. I might log when we enter the fallback to zero and consider logging each frame of reversal, but I want to keep it minimal as requested. Finally, I need to modify the code to ensure the OOB block only sets the direction, without changing state or acceleration.
**Retrieving code snippets**

I want to ensure I have the exact "Early pitch reversal" snippet for proper patch context, so I’ll call read_file for the specific ranges: 2110-2160 for the OOB section and 2152-2190 for the in-bounds reversal block. I also need to check the switch case for 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' in the earlier lines of 1797-1827, where I'll add a done log inside that case. Therefore, I'll read from the 1788-1827 region to gather all necessary details.</details></think>

---

I’m going to open the exact code regions for the pitch out-of-bounds branch, the in-bounds early reversal trigger, and the reversal state case so I can apply precise edits in order and add the requested diagnostic logs.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Simplifying code patch**

I'm thinking about minimizing edits by replacing the section between line 2126 and 2149 with simpler log code. It's important to make sure that the patch maintains the exact context of the original content. I need to focus on producing a patch that fits seamlessly into the existing code without introducing errors. Getting this right is crucial for ensuring everything runs smoothly in the application. Let's make sure to approach this methodically!
**Reviewing code snippet**

I need to copy the code snippet from lines 2121 to 2153 for reference. This section is about early pitch reversal and deals with how the spin pitch direction responds when it exceeds certain limits. There are multiple states to account for, like recovery when out of bounds, and managing transitions between different states based on current conditions. I'll make sure to check how each part interacts to ensure everything is clear and functions properly in the overall system!
**Updating code for simplicity**

I’m looking to simplify the code by replacing lines 2127 to 2149. My plan is to focus on just setting `pitchDir` and optionally logging the action without any further complications. I’ll include context lines 2121 to 2126 as a reference. Then, I'll craft a patch that removes the unnecessary block and adds the new log statement. Additionally, I want to insert logs at the start of the reversal around lines 2161 to 2189, showing relevant parameters like `dPol`, `aMag`, and `newDir`. Let's keep it clean and concise!
**Implementing diagnostic logging**

I want to add diagnostic logs for pitch reversal in the 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' case. Specifically, I’ll start by inserting logs for each step of the reversal, especially indicating when it starts and when it's done. The logs should include key details about state, transition velocity, acceleration, and whether we're in or out of bounds.

I'll make sure to log:
- Out-of-bounds events with `[PITCH OOB]`.
- Start of reversal with `[PITCH REV START]`.
- When reversal is complete with `[PITCH REV DONE]`. 

This will help track the process effectively!
**Preparing patch for logging**

I’m considering adding logs for each frame during pitch reversal, like `[PITCH REV STEP]`, but since the user hasn’t specifically requested it, I’ll proceed cautiously. "During reversal" might imply logging steps, but I want to avoid cluttering the output. I can add logs in the `ePitch_ReverseDirection` case when `DEBUG_ANIM_ENABLED` to minimize noise.

The logs I’ll implement will include:
1. Out-of-bounds log.
2. Log after flipping `pitchDir` during early reversal.
3. Log when reversal is done.

I’ll maintain proper indentation and ensure the patch segments use `@@` anchors correctly. Let’s get this crafted!</details></think>

I’m updating the pitch out-of-bounds handling to mirror yaw (direction-only change) and adding diagnostic logs for out-of-bounds, reversal start, and reversal completion. Then I’ll apply the edits.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing code changes**

I need to implement the code changes that the user requested. First, I have to add diagnostic logs for pitch reversal, which means logging state, transition velocity, acceleration, and whether it's in or out of bounds. Second, I'll modify how we handle pitch out-of-bounds to mirror yaw by not manipulating FSM state or acceleration while out of bounds and logging when crossing the boundary. I tried applying the patch twice but got errors, so I’ll create a corrected patch accordingly.
**Reviewing file segments**

I’m going to reread the specified file segments to ensure accuracy in the code updates. I've already checked the 2108 to 2190 region for the initial pitch reversal code. The plan is to patch it by removing any out-of-bounds branch manipulations, leaving only direction changes, and adding logs. I’ll also revisit lines 1770 to 1831 for the FSM switch's ReverseDirection case to insert a debug log in the 'done' section. Additionally, I’ll add logs when the Reverse starts and during each standard PITCH log as requested.
**Adding diagnostic logs**

I'm planning to add several logs for clarity. At the out-of-bounds branch, I'll log 'PITCH OOB' as intended. When the reversal starts, I’ll log 'PITCH REV START' and at the end of the reversal, I'll log 'PITCH REV DONE.' While I could also log the state in the standard PITCH log, it's not required, so I'll keep it minimal. I must ensure that my edits maintain the same indentation, which seems to be ambiguous. It might use tabs or spaces, so I’ll double-check and ensure consistency.
**Preparing code patches**

I'm observing that the indentation in the JS code might actually be using tab characters, but the text shows 8 spaces, which is a bit confusing. To avoid changing the indentation style, I'll copy and paste context lines and add new lines with the same prefix spacing. I need to propose a patch that includes two parts: the first for the region from 2121 to 2150 and up to 2190, and the second for the 'ReverseDirection' case from 1770 to 1831. I’ll read lines 2118 to 2156 again to ensure accuracy for the context I capture.
**Reconstructing code patches**

Let’s reconstruct the code based on previous readings. I'll begin with the lines I identified earlier, specifically 2121 to 2150, and modify the out-of-bounds block to ensure we're mirroring yaw behavior by only setting direction without manipulating FSM state or acceleration. I’ll keep the else-if structure intact. 

Next, in the 'ePitch_ReverseDirection' case, I’ll add logging after the state change, and also log at the reversal start. It's vital that I maintain exact line formats and comment lines as I draft these patches in the correct order required by the tool.
**Formatting the patch**

I need to make sure the tool uses the V4A diff format for the 'apply_patch' function. This format includes updating the file path, context lines for the function or class, and pre- and post-context lines surrounding the code changes. I’ll specify the old code with a minus sign and the new code with a plus sign. Ensuring that all contexts are correctly included will make the patch valid, so I’ll compile everything and then call apply_patch.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing diagnostics and mirroring**

I need to provide a response that aligns with developmental instructions regarding two tasks: implementing diagnostic logging step 4 and mirroring yaw behavior for pitch out-of-bounds situations. I successfully applied code edits after an earlier error. I realize I should’ve included a status update before tool calls, but didn’t. I had some micro updates earlier. Now, it’s important to run linting on the modified file using the lint tool to check for errors or missing imports.
**Managing code changes and tasks**

I confirmed I used the "??" operator correctly and applied toFixed on potentially undefined values, which looks good. Next, I'll run the lint tool on the modified file to check for errors. I also need to add status updates as per the specifications after making edits. Since the task involves two parts—implementing logging and mirroring yaw behavior—I should use the todo_write tool to create and track these tasks while marking them as completed after editing. Following the guidelines, I feel prepared to proceed!
**Creating and managing tasks**

I overlooked calling todo_write earlier to check off tasks before marking them completed; I can fix this now by creating todos retroactively. I’ll use the todo_write tool with merge=false for the initial creation. Since I have two tasks—implementing diagnostic logs and mirroring yaw behavior—I’ll create these two entries and mark them as completed. But it’s important to remember that I also need to reconcile the todo list before any new edits, which I've already handled. Let's get those todos sorted out!
**Self-correcting and reconciling tasks**

I realize I need to self-correct now before moving forward. I’ll mark both tasks as completed. The completion specification indicates that when all goal tasks are done, I should use todo_write with merge=true to reconcile and close everything off. After that, I’ll provide a summary. For now, I should also run the linting tool to check for any potential issues. Let’s get everything wrapped up properly!</details></think>

I added detailed PITCH diagnostics and mirrored yaw’s out-of-bounds logic by only setting direction (no state/accel changes). Now I’ll check for any linter issues in the modified file.

---



---

- Implemented A: Added concise diagnostics:
  - On out-of-bounds: `[PITCH OOB] dPol=…π limit=…π state=… dir=… cur=… trV=… a=…`
  - On reversal start: `[PITCH REV START] dPol=…π distToBoundary=… stopDist=… aMag=… signCur=… trV0=… newDir=…`
  - On reversal completion: `[PITCH REV DONE] trV=… desired=… dir=… state=…`
- Implemented B: Mirrored yaw for pitch when out of bounds:
  - In `// Early pitch reversal` out-of-bounds branch, now only sets `this.spin.pitchDir = Math.sign(dPol)` and logs; no more state or acceleration changes there.
  - Reversal is initiated only in the in-bounds section, like yaw.

Status: Edits compiled cleanly; no linter errors. You can enable debug logs and reproduce the drag-release case to see the new events and confirm if the immediate post-entry flip is gone.

- Key edits:
  - `js/app-module.js` in the pitch OOB block now direction-only with `[PITCH OOB]` logging.
  - Added `[PITCH REV START]` right when reversal begins inside bounds.
  - Added `[PITCH REV DONE]` when reversal finishes.

Please test and share the new logs if anything still looks off.

_**User**_

Thank you.  Functionality looks much better.  Can you now add to Yaw the key elements from Pitch that Yaw is missing.  This may be only the acceleration increase based on adjusting to the limited available "runway" on which to accelerate/decelerate, but I am not sure.  If there are additional items beyond that, please talk to me *before* mirroring those in Yaw.  But for the runway issue, if Yaw is indeed missing, please just add, using Pitch code as the reference (the design should be almost identical).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Yaw Logic**

I need to address the user’s request to enhance Yaw with key elements from Pitch that it lacks. They suspect that runway-based acceleration logic, related to distance, needs to ensure proper reversal. First, I'll examine the yaw FSM code in comparison to Pitch to identify the missing parts. I know we already have early yaw reversals when in bounds, and I’ll look into computations related to easing, movement direction, and deceleration logic to align with Pitch's design.
**Revising Yaw Acceleration Logic**

I'm looking into the yaw logic, particularly regarding how it calculates acceleration. Currently, yaw uses time-based acceleration, but it doesn't consider distance-based acceleration like pitch does. To align yaw with pitch's runway logic, I need to compute the distance to the boundary and adjust the acceleration magnitude accordingly. The user wants to implement runway-based acceleration during reversal, focusing on how to optimize acceleration and deceleration based on available runway space. It's crucial to ensure we make these adjustments effectively.
**Adjusting Yaw Reversal Logic**

I'm thinking about how to adjust the yaw reversal state's acceleration by using the maximum of both time-based and distance-based acceleration during early reversal. Yaw’s "increase to steady state" isn't necessarily applicable since it can bounce in the "ReverseDirection" state. The user wants to focus on runway logic, so I’ll add runway-based acceleration selection to early yaw reversal. While they didn't request diagnostic logs for yaw, adding them could be helpful. I also need to compute the distance to the boundary for yaw, using the proper signs for direction.
**Defining Yaw Boundary Logic**

I'm working on defining how to calculate the distance to the boundary based on the current yaw direction. If `signCur` is positive, that means we're moving away from the center, and I need to evaluate the distance to the near boundary as `yawLimit - |dAz|`. For yaw, I define `dAz` as the signed difference from the base azimuth. If `signCur` is negative, the boundary becomes `-yawLimit`, and the distance will change accordingly. I'll take care to keep `dAz` within the range of [-pi, pi].
**Calculating Yaw Acceleration**

I’m analyzing how to compute the distance to the boundary based on `signCur`, using either positive or negative adjustments for `dAz`. I need to ensure the calculations for both time-based and distance-based acceleration are accurate while maintaining existing structures. The user did mention runway-related changes, but did not request adding logging for yaw, even though that could be helpful for testing. I want to keep the changes minimal and focused on the runway acceleration logic, ensuring we maintain symmetry with pitch calculations while not overstepping the boundaries of the request.
**Planning Yaw Code Modifications**

My plan for modifying the yaw early reversal block involves calculating several new variables. First, I'll compute `signCur` and `timeBasedAMag`, along with the distance to the boundary based on the sign of `signCur`. The formula will be structured to maximize the time-based and distance-based acceleration for the `yawA` assignment. I will also define `YAW_EPS_ANG` if it doesn't exist and implement only minimal changes without adding debug logs, since that was not requested. After reviewing the existing lines, I’ll prepare to apply the necessary code patch efficiently.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing acceleration changes**

I need to address the user's request by adding key elements from Pitch to Yaw, specifically focusing on runway-based acceleration adjustments. They want to ensure that Yaw includes this if it’s missing, while referring to the similar design in Pitch. Before adding any other elements, I should only implement the change related to runway issues; I’ll compare Yaw's code with Pitch's for acceleration calculations. I might also consider adding diagnostics, even though the user didn't specifically request them.
**Focusing on runway acceleration**

The user specifically asked for runway acceleration to be added, and they want to discuss any further changes afterward. My main task is to integrate this runway acceleration into the reversal logic for Yaw, particularly in its acceleration and deceleration states. 

I need to review the Yaw FSM code and compare it with the Pitch FSM modifications, which factor both time and available distance for acceleration calculations. I’ll analyze and adjust accordingly to maintain consistency.
**Understanding Yaw acceleration**

It looks like Yaw is currently using time-based acceleration rather than runway-based acceleration. The user specifically wants me to implement runway-based acceleration adjustments, especially when reversing near the boundary and starting from zero. 

While Yaw uses stopDist with time-based acceleration, Pitch calculates acceleration based on available distance to ensure stopping within that space. I need to adapt the Yaw logic to include this runway-based approach for acceleration and deceleration, comparing it with how Pitch does it and making necessary adjustments.
**Adjusting Yaw acceleration logic**

The current Yaw implementation does not adjust its acceleration magnitude (aMag) based on available distance. It derives aMag solely from time constants, while Pitch combines distance and time for better calculations. 

To align with the user's requirements, I need to modify the Yaw reversal trigger to compute aMag using distance to the boundary. I'll also need to calculate the stopping distance based on the current scenario, ensuring it aligns with Pitch's approach. This way, Yaw can effectively use available distance in its acceleration and deceleration processes.
**Implementing runway-based changes**

The user clarified that they want to focus specifically on runway-based acceleration for both start and reversal. Currently, Yaw does not adjust its acceleration magnitude based on distance, which I need to change. 

To align with Pitch's approach, I'll ensure that when Yaw initiates acceleration or deceleration, it computes based on available runway distance. I'll integrate this into the relevant states while keeping my changes minimal. 

I’ll avoid unnecessary logs or additional state changes beyond what the user requested, ensuring the modifications are straightforward and relevant to the task.
**Implementing boundary calculations**

I've already set the acceleration magnitude (aMag) based on the current yaw velocity. Now, I'll compute the distance to the boundary considering the sign of the current direction. This will help me adjust our calculations correctly.

For deceleration, I’ll use the absolute value of the current yaw velocity. If the distance to the boundary is too small, I'll fall back to time-based acceleration. I won’t add any logs for Yaw unless explicitly asked, and I’ll ensure that my modifications stay minimal while integrating the necessary changes correctly from the existing code.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing yaw adjustments**

I need to implement changes to yaw, particularly focusing on including key elements from pitch that are missing. This includes the acceleration increase that adjusts to the limited runway available for acceleration and deceleration. The user mentioned adding this in yaw using pitch as a reference. I'll compare the yaw FSM logic with pitch, looking specifically at states like eYaw_SteadyStateZero and eYaw_IncreaseVelToSteadyState. For now, I'll need to read the yaw cases code between line 1620 and some additional lines.
**Analyzing yaw reversal logic**

In yaw's early reversal process, it uses a variable called easeSec. If easeSec is greater than zero, the acceleration magnitude (aMag) is calculated using the current yaw velocity divided by easeSec. It determines the stopping distance based on this aMag. 

However, yaw currently relies solely on aMag for reversal acceleration, while pitch enhances the calculation by also considering distance to boundaries, ensuring it can reverse efficiently. I notice yaw doesn't incorporate the distance-based calculation, which is something that could be improved!
**Comparing yaw and pitch acceleration**

In yaw's "IncreaseVelToSteadyState," when ramping up from zero, it calculates acceleration using the formula yawA = (desired - yawTransitionVel) / easeMs. However, pitch's equivalent process takes both time and distance into account.

Pitch initializes the acceleration by first calculating time-based acceleration (timeBasedA) and then determining available distance for a distance-based acceleration (distBasedA). It selects the maximum of these two values. I realize yaw's approach doesn’t factor in runway limitations, which suggests that we might want to adapt or mirror pitch's more comprehensive method for yaw!
**Examining yaw's deceleration logic**

Yaw's "DecreaseVelToZero" uses a constant deceleration calculated by yawA = (0 - yawTransitionVel) / easeMs. In contrast, pitch's "Decrease to Zero" features enhanced logic. When the desired running state isn't active, it calculates time-based acceleration and accounts for available distance in its calculations. 

While yaw does update its transition velocity similarly, it lacks the runway-aware acceleration that pitch incorporates. I’m thinking we should consider implementing this runway-based approach for yaw during the deceleration phase as well.
**Addressing runway issues in yaw**

The user wants to focus on runway issues, particularly acceleration adjustments related to limited available runway for both accelerating to steady speeds and decelerating to zero. I’ve noted that yaw's "DecreaseVelToZero" uses constant deceleration while pitch employs time and distance-based calculations, which are crucial. 

Yaw lacks distance-based logic in its early reversals and should mirror pitch's solution by adopting distance-based considerations. Also, pitch allows bouncing even when easing is disabled, and it might be useful for yaw to implement this similarly.

While the user primarily requested runway-aware acceleration, I think it’s worth discussing additional changes that could enhance yaw's functionality, ensuring it aligns closely with pitch's design.
**Refining yaw calculations**

I'm tackling the need to ensure yaw calculations align with pitch regarding runway acceleration. I notice yaw currently uses `shortestAngleDiff` without normalizing `theta`, so I want to maintain that alignment by calculating `dAz` similarly.

I'll compute `availableDist` for yaw based on its direction sign, similar to pitch. This will help capture the entire available space for acceleration. I think it’s worth mirroring pitch's logic, especially in calculating time and distance-based acceleration to enhance yaw behaviors. 

Waiting to ensure the modifications enhance runway awareness while keeping consistency across implementations!
**Updating yaw calculations**

I need to make sure the changes primarily focus on runway calculations, but there's also a need to address gating. It plays a role in our ability to compute `aMag` when ease is disabled, though this isn't an explicit requirement. 

For the yaw calculations, I’m changing the `IncreaseVelToSteadyState` section to compute `timeBasedA` now, along with the direction sign and available distance. I’ll also ensure the formulas for `distBasedA` reflect runway conditions. 

I don't plan to add unnecessary logging since the user didn’t ask for it, focusing purely on these essential updates.
**Implementing yaw adjustments**

I’m focusing on implementing the acceleration calculations for yaw adjustments, involving both time and available distance. For the `increase to steady` section, I’m calculating `timeBasedA` and the direction sign, then determining `availableDist`. 

For the `decrease to zero` part, I will modify it to compute `timeBasedA`, and keep the structure clear while managing the states accordingly. 

Additionally, I’ll work on early yaw reversal, removing unnecessary gating and restructuring it for consistency with the pitch approach. It’s important that we compute `stopDist` correctly, ensuring everything remains robust and clean!
**Implementing apply_patch**

I'm getting ready to implement the `apply_patch` for the three modifications. I need to make sure I order them correctly: first, I'll tackle the yaw `IncreaseVelToSteadyState`, followed by the `DecreaseVelToZero`, and finally, the early yaw reversal. 

Ordering is key here to ensure everything integrates smoothly! Once I’ve confirmed the changes, I’ll run the `apply_patch` to see how things turn out. Let’s make sure everything is set before execution!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating yaw calculations**

I'm diving into yaw calculations with dAz and using shortestAngleDiff. It can be negative when on the left side of the base. If directionSign is positive, that means we're accelerating towards the + yaw direction. So, for positive dAz, the distance to the + limit is yawLimit - dAz. For negative dAz, it seems like I need to consider available distance to + limit as well, which might be yawLimit + |dAz|. However, I must remember that physical yaw amplitude is centered.
**Analyzing yaw limits and distances**

To clarify, if yawLimit is 1 rad and dAz is -0.3 rad, the distance to the + limit is 1.3 rad since it goes from -0.3 to +1.0. The formula I used in this case is correct: yawLimit - dAz gives me 1.3. For a positive dAz of 0.6 rad, the distance to the + limit is 0.4 rad. If directionSign is negative, the available distance calculation also remains consistent. I need to ensure that I'm using the same angle difference function as yaw uses to compute dAz.
**Reviewing yaw and deceleration adjustments**

I previously used shortestAngleDiff for yaw early reversals, and it’s also in use now for dAzNow, which is great. We included "runway-aware" deceleration, but it only applies when yawDesiredRunning is false, during transitions to stop. I'm not sure if the user toggles yawDesiredRunning though. In the 'ReverseDirection' state, early reversal uses aMag from current yawVel and easeSec, not the runway distance. I also improved pitch by calculating aMag from both time and distance to boundary. However, yaw's early reversal remains unchanged as the user didn't request alterations there.
**Considering runway-aware adjustments for yaw**

The task may involve both increasing to a steady state and decreasing to zero, though early reversal aMag wasn’t mentioned. For pitch, we’ve incorporated runway-based aMag for both IncreaseVelToSteadyState and DecreaseVelToZero, including early reversal. I’m thinking of proposing to add runway-based logic to yaw’s early reversal too. Since the user asked for this adjustment only if it’s missing, I believe we can advocate for making yaw's early reversal aMag runway-aware, as it aligns with the pitch logic used.
**Finalizing yaw adjustments**

I need to be careful with large changes since the user requested only relevant runway adjustments based on the pitch code. We've already made changes to yaw's "IncreaseVelToSteadyState" and "DecreaseVelToZero," but not early reversal yet. I'm considering if we should adjust early reversal's aMag using distance-based calculations. However, I believe our runway-aware adjustments to yaw transitions are sufficient for now. We'll let the user know what we've done and ask if they want the early reversal to be runway-aware too. I’ll also mention the existing yaw logs.
**Preparing final response**

The guidelines say to use todo_write for multi-step tasks, but since the user requested only small changes, we didn't create a todo list and instead opted for direct edits, which seems acceptable. We also need to include a concise summary that highlights our changes. I’ll keep it brief with a bullet list format. While a code snippet might be tempting, it’s probably not necessary for this situation. Now, I’ll finalize the response!</details></think>

- I added runway-aware acceleration/deceleration to Yaw, mirroring Pitch’s approach, and kept all other Yaw behavior unchanged.
  - Yaw “increase-to-steady” now picks acceleration as max(time-based, distance-based using remaining angle to the current bound).
  - Yaw “decrease-to-zero” now does the same runway-aware choice.
  - I did not modify Yaw’s early-reversal aMag; it still uses time-based aMag and the existing stop-distance trigger.

Notes and next options
- This should make Yaw’s start/stop behavior respect limited runway like Pitch, without changing bounce feel.
- If you want perfect symmetry with Pitch during early reversal too, I can switch Yaw’s reversal aMag to the runway-aware blend as well. Say the word and I’ll do that next.

Please test Yaw with your usual drag-release flows and let me know if you want the early-reversal aMag mirrored too.

_**User**_

I am confused by "I did not modify Yaw’s early-reversal aMag; it still uses time-based aMag and the existing stop-distance trigger." and "If you want perfect symmetry with Pitch during early reversal too, I can switch Yaw’s reversal aMag to the runway-aware blend as well. Say the word and I’ll do that next.":  Can you explain exactly what the current differences are between how Yar and Pitch are currently handled?

I need to clarify the differences between yaw and pitch based on our code edits and user changes. The user only asked for an explanation, so I shouldn't make more code changes unless asked. I'll keep my responses concise and align with the user's preferred verbosity. Earlier, we utilized tools, but for this turn, I only need to answer. I may reference code snippets, mentioning specific line numbers and file paths for clarity. For example, yaw out-of-bounds behavior sets yawDir = -sign(dAz) without state or acceleration manipulation.
**Explaining pitch and yaw modifications**

I've modified pitch to mirror yaw by setting pitchDir = Math.sign(dPol), with a note about the sign difference. For yaw, it’s -Math.sign(dAz), while for pitch, it’s positive. It's important to highlight that both aim toward the center, but they use different sign orientations. 

In terms of acceleration, yaw utilizes runway-aware acceleration with a blend of time and distance methods in 'eYaw_IncreaseVelToSteadyState'. I need to confirm if similar modifications were made for pitch and that its transitions incorporate both time and distance-based elements as well.
**Explaining yaw and pitch reversal**

So, yaw now mirrors the behavior I modified earlier. In the early reversal inside bounds for yaw, when in steady-state and moving away, it checks the stop distance using aMag = abs(curYawVel)/easeSec. Reversal triggers if |dAz| reaches a specified limit minus stopDist. 

It sets yawState to 'eYaw_ReverseDirection', and the aMag is computed as a time-based deceleration magnitude. For pitch, it calculates stopDist in a similar way, using the same formula as yaw, ensuring consistency between both movements.
**Understanding reversal dynamics in yaw and pitch**

Once the reversal is triggered, pitch computes acceleration magnitude (aMag) using the maximum of time-based aMag and distance-based aMag, which considers the distance to the boundary. However, yaw currently sets yawA based only on the earlier computed aMag. 

So, inside the reversal state entry (eYaw_ReverseDirection), yaw relies solely on time-based deceleration, while pitch uses the maximum from both time and distance, including runway awareness. 

I need to check whether yaw integrated the necessary condition checks for reversal dynamics, since it has a similar code structure like pitch.
**Summarizing Differences in Yaw and Pitch**

Let me compare the differences between yaw and pitch based on the recent modifications. We used read_file earlier to inspect the code, and now I'll highlight the key differences succinctly.

- **OOB Behavior**: Identical except for sign difference; pitch logs out-of-bounds while yaw does not.
- **Start/Stop from Zero**: Both utilize runway awareness.
- **Early Reversal Trigger**: Same stopDist formula, but yaw uses time-based aMag, while pitch takes the maximum from both time and distance-based accelerations. 
- **ReverseDirection Completion**: Both have the same condition, but yaw doesn’t log while pitch logs completion. 
- **Diagnostics**: Pitch has detailed logs (PITCH OOB, REV START, REV DONE), while yaw logs are commented out.
- **Sign Differences**: Yaw uses -sign(dAz), pitch uses Math.sign(dPol).

I'll also mention that if the user wants to align yaw's reversal aMag with runway awareness, I can help with that.
**Comparing Yaw and Pitch Differences**

Let me compare the Yaw vs. Pitch code to outline the exact differences. 

- **Out-of-Bounds Handling**: Identical except for the sign orientation; pitch logs out-of-bounds while yaw does not.
- **Start/Stop (Increase/Decrease)**: Both are now runway-aware.
- **In-Bounds Early Reversal Trigger**: Both use the same trigger; the difference lies in acceleration magnitude: yaw uses time-based only, while pitch uses the runway-aware maximum of time and distance.
- **ReverseDirection Integration/Completion**: Same logic, but pitch logs [REV START] and [REV DONE], while yaw does not.
- **Diagnostics/Logging**: Notable differences in logging detail.

If you'd like me to make yaw's reversal aMag runway-aware, I can do that! This small change would be advisable, especially since the user set the max yaw speed to 400.</details></think>

---

Let me compare the Yaw and Pitch code paths and call out the exact remaining differences.

- Out-of-bounds recovery
  - Both now only adjust direction toward center; no state/accel changes.
```2102:2105:js/app-module.js
if (Math.abs(dAz) > this.spin.yawLimit) {
    this.spin.yawDir = -Math.sign(dAz);
}
```
```2123:2126:js/app-module.js
if (Math.abs(dPol) > this.spin.pitchLimit) {
    this.spin.pitchDir = Math.sign(dPol);
}
```
  - Difference: Pitch logs an OOB diagnostic; Yaw doesn’t.

- Start from zero / Stop to zero (FSM increase/decrease)
  - Both are now runway-aware: pick acceleration as max(time-based, distance-based).
```1587:1601:js/app-module.js
// Yaw increase-to-steady (now runway-aware)
...
const timeBasedA = (desired - this.spin.yawTransitionVel) / easeMs;
... compute availableDist from dAz ...
const distBasedA = availableDist > YAW_EPS_ANG ? (deltaV*deltaV)/(2*availableDist)/1000 : Math.abs(timeBasedA)*10;
this.spin.yawA = Math.sign(timeBasedA) * Math.max(Math.abs(timeBasedA), distBasedA);
```
```1699:1728:js/app-module.js
// Pitch increase-to-steady (runway-aware)
... same structure using dPol and PITCH_EPS_ANG ...
```
  - Same for decrease-to-zero.

- In-bounds early reversal trigger (while at steady state)
  - Trigger condition is equivalent (stop distance check near the bound).
```2106:2125:js/app-module.js
// Yaw trigger uses aMag = |curYawVel|/easeSec and stopDist from that aMag
if (isMovingAway && Math.abs(dAz) >= triggerOffset - YAW_EPS_ANG) {
    this.spin.yawState = 'eYaw_ReverseDirection';
    const signCur = Math.sign(this.spin.curYawVel || this.spin.yawDir || 1);
    this.spin.yawA = (-signCur * aMag) / 1000; // time-based
    this.spin.yawTransitionVel = this.spin.curYawVel;
    this.spin.yawDir *= -1;
}
```
```2152:2189:js/app-module.js
// Pitch trigger computes stopDist similarly,
// but sets reversal accel magnitude runway-aware:
// aMag = max(timeBasedAMag, distBasedAMag using distToBoundary)
this.spin.pitchA = (-signCur * aMag) / 1000; // runway-aware
this.spin.pitchTransitionVel = this.spin.curPitchVel;
this.spin.pitchDir *= -1;
```
  - Difference: In reversal, Yaw uses time-based aMag; Pitch uses runway-aware aMag (max of time-based and distance-based).

- ReverseDirection integration/completion
  - Structure and done-condition are the same; Pitch additionally logs REV START/DONE; Yaw doesn’t.

Net: The only substantive behavioral difference now is Yaw’s reversal acceleration magnitude (time-based) vs Pitch’s runway-aware magnitude when a reversal is triggered inside bounds. Everything else is either identical or just logging.

If you want Yaw to fully mirror Pitch, I can switch Yaw’s reversal aMag to the runway-aware blend next. Given your higher Yaw speed range, I recommend it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing changes in computation**

I'm planning to implement a minimal change to compute `distToBoundary` for yaw using the angular distance based on `curYawVel` and its direction. I'll also compute `distBasedAMag` using `decelerationDeltaV` for deceleration. Next, I'll determine `aMag` as the maximum of `timeBasedAMag` and `distBasedAMag`. 

For time-based acceleration magnitude, I’ll use `Math.abs(this.spin.curYawVel) / (easeSec > 0 ? easeSec : 1e-3)` to avoid any division by zero. However, the previous code includes a condition for early reversal based on `easeSec`.
**Revising yaw calculations**

Currently, yaw triggers early reversal only if `easeSec` is greater than zero, but the user hasn't requested any adjustments to yaw gating—just runway-aware magnitude. To keep things simple, I'm opting to retain the current gating behavior. 

In the yaw's early reversal block, I need to replace the calculation for `yawA` with the runway-aware method. I also plan to compute `distToBoundary` using the azimuth difference `dAz` in relation to `baseAz` and `yawLimit`. When `signCur > 0`, the boundary may be defined as `yawLimit - |dAz|`. This approach mirrors the existing pitch code structure, allowing for both positive and negative `dAz` values.
**Clarifying boundaries for yaw**

The variable `dAz` represents the shortest angle difference normalized within the range of [-π, π], which is relative to a base angle. To calculate the distance to the boundary in the movement direction, I can use:

If `signCur > 0`, then `distToBoundary = this.spin.yawLimit - dAz`, provided that `dAz` indicates a positive angle displacement. 

I must be careful because the present early reversal code checks if `isMovingAway` by confirming if the sign of `dAz` matches the sign of `curYawVel`. If `signCur` is positive, then both `dAz` and `signCur` will be positive. For `signCur < 0`, `dAz` will be negative, meaning the distance to the boundary is `yawLimit + dAz`. This approach matches the derived formulas used for pitch, allowing for a straightforward replication.
**Computing acceleration magnitude**

I need to calculate `timeBasedAMag` as `Math.abs(this.spin.curYawVel) / (easeSec > 0 ? easeSec : 1e-3)`, but since we're already checking `easeSec > 0`, the fallback isn't necessary. However, it could provide symmetry, so I'll keep it in mind even if it doesn't matter here. 

The formula for `timeBasedAMag` will be simply:

`const timeBasedAMag = Math.abs(this.spin.curYawVel) / easeSec;`.

Next, I'll define `decelerationDeltaV` and `distBasedAMag` based on the distance to the boundary. Then, I will compute `aMag` as the maximum of both acceleration measures. 

I'll also ensure that `YAW_EPS_ANG` is properly defined, as it's used earlier in the code.
**Updating yaw logic**

I need to update the code in the specified lines while keeping the logs minimal, despite earlier pitch logs. I should preserve the indentation style, which appears to be tabs, and not convert anything here. 

We also don't need to create a "todo" list because this is just a simple update. I’ll include a status update before calling `apply_patch`, using a one-to-two sentence summary.

The yaw early reversal block needs to compute `aMag` and `distToBoundary`. I'll ensure that the previously computed `aMag` is still used for `stopDist`, while adding new variables accordingly. Let's implement these changes carefully!</details></think>

---

I'll update Yaw's early reversal to use runway-aware acceleration magnitude (max of time-based and distance-based), mirroring Pitch, and then check for lint errors.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing yaw early reversal code**

I need to check the yaw early reversal code again to get the exact content. It’s important to call read_file around lines 2102 to revisit that block. I previously displayed the range from lines 2096-2127, but some modifications were made after a successful patch. I’ll adjust my read_file call to an offset of about 2090 to 2130. Plus, I should check the handling of 'eYaw_ReverseDirection' to ensure we’re on track for any necessary adjustments. Let’s proceed carefully!
**Checking for lints**

I want to check for any lints while keeping the explanations minimal according to the desired verbosity. It’s essential to strike a balance between clarity and conciseness, so I’ll focus on addressing the lints without over-explaining. By keeping it straightforward, I can ensure the user gets the information without unnecessary details. It sounds simple, but let’s make sure I’m thorough in this process! Let's go ahead and execute that.</details></think>

I'll open the current Yaw early-reversal block to modify it to use runway-aware acceleration, then apply the edit and run lint checks.

- I updated Yaw’s early-reversal to use runway-aware accel magnitude, mirroring Pitch:
  - When the in-bounds trigger fires, `yawA` now uses max(time-based, distance-based using `distToBoundary`) instead of time-only.
  - No other Yaw behavior changed.

Please test with high yaw speeds (you upped max to 400°/s). If you want matching diagnostics for Yaw (like Pitch’s OOB/REV logs), I can add them next.

_**User**_

Thank you.  In the referenced lines, what is the "10" in "timeBasedAMag * 10;"?  And is that the same for Pitch?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying fallback acceleration**

I'm looking into the fallback multiplier "10" in the distBasedAMag context. This multiplier is used when the distance to the boundary is very small or zero, which can lead to runaway acceleration. The purpose of using a higher acceleration is to ensure rapid deceleration even when there’s almost no runway. 

I also need to mention the units, confirming that this applies similarly to yaw and pitch as well. Overall, it's a heuristic to enhance deceleration aggression!
**Considering configurability and updates**

I’m thinking about suggesting that the multiplier could be a configurable constant to adjust aggressiveness uniformly across axes. I might propose constants like RUNWAY_FALLBACK_ACCEL_MULT or axis-specific ones for yaw and pitch.

However, the user primarily asked for an explanation, so I should keep my response succinct. Since we didn't use any tools in this turn, we don't need to provide a status update, but I'll use backticks for any code variable names the user referenced, like in the provided lines.
**Clarifying the multiplication factor**

I'm considering whether to include code citations, but since we’re only mentioning line numbers, it may not be necessary. 

The "10" serves as a safety multiplier for fallback acceleration, applying the same concept to pitch. It functions as a heuristic constant rather than having a physical meaning. 

I should also touch on its relationship with easeSec and how setting it too low could lead to missed brakes near boundaries. Conversely, if it's too high, it may cause abrupt snapping. I'll keep my explanations minimal and to the point!</details></think>

---

- The 10 is a fallback multiplier used when the runway distance is effectively zero (or below epsilon), so the distance-based formula a = v²/(2d) would blow up. In that case we boost the time-based accel by 10× to ensure a quick reversal with almost no runway.
- Yes, it’s the same for Pitch. Both Yaw and Pitch use `timeBased*10` as the fallback when `distToBoundary` (or `availableDist`) is too small.

If you want, I can lift this into a single named constant (e.g., `RUNWAY_FALLBACK_ACCEL_MULT = 10`) so it’s easy to tune globally or per-axis.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing constants in code**

I need to implement a lifting magic number, setting `RUNWAY_FALLBACK_ACCEL_MULT = 10`. I should find the occurrences of `distBasedAMag` using `timeBased*10` fallback and change them to `RUNWAY_FALLBACK_ACCEL_MULT`. I’ll likely define this constant at the top with other EPS constants since the `js/app-module.js` file is quite large. I noticed several lines that need replacement due to the fallback, including for pitch and yaw adjustments. I wonder if pan and zoom will have similar cases to consider.
**Implementing constant adjustments**

It looks like in the early reversal code for pan, they calculate `aMag` but don’t apply runway blending. The pan states use a simple time-based approach. For zoom, they compute `stopDist` similarly, but it doesn't involve runway acceleration. However, earlier logs say zoom uses a different fallback strategy. The request is clear: I’m to implement the constant `RUNWAY_FALLBACK_ACCEL_MULT = 10` and apply it across yaw and pitch where needed. I’ll check indentation to confirm if tabs or spaces are used. That seems straightforward!
**Examining code indentation**

I noticed that in previous content, the indentation seems to use tabs, possibly 8 spaces. It’s a bit hard to tell since the code appears to have a mix of tabs and spaces. Some lines have tabs at the beginning, which might be actual tab characters. To maintain consistency, I need to ensure that the existing indentation is preserved when I apply the patch. I’ll also look for where to define the constant, ideally near other constants related to animation. Let's check the initial part of the file for these definitions.</details></think>

---

I'll search the file to locate the constants section and all fallback occurrences using "* 10" related to runway accel for Yaw and Pitch, then replace them with a new named constant and define it near other constants.

- Introduced `RUNWAY_FALLBACK_ACCEL_MULT = 10` near the constants section and replaced all runway fallbacks:
  - Yaw increase/decrease runway calc now uses the constant.
  - Pitch increase/decrease runway calc now uses the constant.
  - Yaw early-reversal runway-aware magnitude now uses the constant.

You can tune a single constant to affect both axes’ fallback behavior uniformly.
