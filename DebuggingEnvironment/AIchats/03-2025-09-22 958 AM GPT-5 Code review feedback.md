I am coming back to you here after working with another AI on the problem, and a previous chat with you. I want to share that interaction with you, and the current html file, and then I want to just talk with you (no code) yet regarding the points outlined below. Please read all attached files as a starting point. (Note: The code is making it further along than it had been, but is still crashing well before even one limit-bounce cycle is complete. I will provide log data, but only \*after\* we address the below.) 1) What do you think of the current code generally (2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sealed-v1.2.9.html)? 2) In particular: a) Our spec had: "\*\*EPS single source of truth\*\* — `EPS.x, EPS.v, EPS.t, EPS.sel` are used consistently by selector and stages. The neutral band (`EPS.sel`) lives \*\*only\*\* in the selector to prevent boundary chatter (physics remains pure).", yet I see random hard-coded values throughout. b) AIs keep responding to problems in operation with "symptom band aids", rather that addressing root causes, making the code more more more buggy, messy, harder to read, etc. In that regard, please carefully review current html file, and note any code sections that even conceivably might fall into that band aid category, commenting on why you think so, how/where we might properly fix, etc. c) More generally, as you go though code, very every issue: i) Look at "the weeds", code/physics/functionality-wise. ii) But never, ever, omit "backing up to see the forest", to decide if our whole design, or some module therein, is flawed at its core, and we need to rethink things.

Thought for 4m 26s

Got it—I read your three attachments end-to-end and focused on the current file you named (the “v1.2.9” HTML; header shows “v1.2.6 (Fix)”). Here’s my “weeds + forest” take, no code yet.

1) Overall on the current code (v1.2.9)
=======================================

It’s a useful step forward (analytic sub-frame events are there, a `toV0` path exists, and the observer is richer), but the architecture has drifted from our spec. In particular, selector responsibilities are mixed into the stage/physics planner, EPS isn’t centralized, and a few “operational fixes” creep into the control path (they make a symptom go away short-term, but add new failure modes and obscure the intent). That mismatch is the most likely reason you’re still crashing before a clean first cycle. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea… 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…

2) Specifics
============

(a) EPS single source of truth / neutral-band placement
-------------------------------------------------------

*   **Spec intent:** one EPS and selector-only stickiness; the physics stays pure, stages don’t carry hysteresis. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **Current file:** scattered literals (`1e-6`, `1e-5`, `1e-9`, etc.) and a **hard-coded neutral band inside `planAccel`** (`neutralBand = 0.5 /*deg*/`). That violates both “single EPS” and “selector-only neutral band.” This will absolutely cause hard-to-reproduce edge behavior near the accel↔decel boundary. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea…  
    **Verdict:** move all tolerances to `EPS.*`, remove neutral-band logic from the physics planner, and apply the stickiness only in the selector per spec. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    

(b) “Band-aid” patterns I’d unwind (and why)
--------------------------------------------

*   **Consume-the-rest “hold” after `toV0`.** The current integrator stops short and then **eats the remainder of the frame at rest**, forcing `dtLeft=0`. That silences the immediate re-accel seam, but it also breaks the orchestrator contract (selector can’t re-decide in the remainder of the slice), and it papers over incorrect selection near the apex. This is symptomatic, not causal. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea…
    
*   **Velocity-scaled brake multiplier (1→3×).** In decel you scale the commanded magnitude by an overspeed factor. That’s not in the shaping law; it couples an ad-hoc gain to state and hides where braking really needs to be decided (selector vs stage). It can also produce inconsistent “dv vs a·dt” at coarse `dt`. I’d delete or gate this behind diagnostics—physics should remain pure. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea…
    
*   **Neutral band inside the planner.** Already noted above; putting hysteresis in the law instead of the selector blurs responsibilities and is how “sticky” accel shows up near apex with small `dRem`. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea…
    
*   **Outside-recovery sign pick.** The current “outside” branch fixes `phase='decel'` and derives sign from `dir` rather than explicitly choosing the **inward** sign that reduces `|x|-L`. That’s a correctness land-mine if `dir` doesn’t match the nearest boundary (e.g., after an odd resume/pause). Per spec, outside-recovery is inward-only, independent of mid-travel `dir`. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea… 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **I1 (“no-brake-away”) effectively disabled.** I see the I1 block commented out in the planner. Disabling I1 is why a stop-short (`toV0`) can be followed by decel-away on the next planning step. The fix is to **enforce I1 in the selector**, not to clamp time with “rest” pieces. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea… 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    

(c) Weeds → Forest: what to change vs what to keep
--------------------------------------------------

### The weeds (surgical, correctness-first)

*   **Re-separate roles:** a 5-line **selector** (with EPS + neutral band + I1/I2) that outputs a stage; **stages** do pure kinematics and ordered events (`land > toV0 > toVmax`); **orchestrator** consumes exactly `dt` across pieces; **observer** stays out of the control path. That’s our spec’s spine. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **Centralize EPS:** every tolerance (`x, v, t, sel`) comes from one place; kill local `1e-6/-5/-9` sprinkles. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **Put stickiness back where it belongs:** neutral band lives only in the selector; remove it from `planAccel`. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **Restore I1 in selector (not planner):** on `v_tow ≤ EPS.v`, select **Accel**. That prevents “decel-away” without time-clamping hacks. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **Fix outside-recovery sign:** choose sign that reduces `|x|-L` (nearest-apex inward), not `-dir`. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   **Remove velocity-scaled braking from the law:** keep decel at `min(acap, v_tow²/(2d))` and let the selector/event ordering handle the rest. (It’s fine to leave your **observer** thresholds as they are; they’re diagnostic, not physics.) 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    

### The forest (why this matters)

Right now, multiple responsibilities live in one function, so “one small fix” changes behavior elsewhere. Returning to the spec’s isolation (selector ↔ stages ↔ orchestrator ↔ observer) gives us two benefits you’ve been asking for repeatedly: (1) once a stage works, later edits can’t break it; (2) regressions are legible in the logs (the wrong **selector** choice, or the wrong **event** inside a stage, not a mushy blend). That’s the fastest path to a boringly correct first cycle and a clean limit-bounce. 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…

* * *

Small but real paper-cuts I’d also address
------------------------------------------

*   **Versioning confusion:** filename says 1.2.9; header says 1.2.6. Make the title reflect the file—this bit you earlier during testing. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea…
    
*   **`dt` default:** your current file boots with `dt=100 ms`, which exaggerates boundary seams visually and numerically; keep 16.67 ms by default (you had that in the 1.2.5 consolidated build). 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea… yaw-1axis-sealed-v1.2.5-alt
    

* * *

Bottom line
-----------

*   The **root cause** of the pre-cycle crash is architectural drift: selector rules (EPS, neutral band, I1) leaked into the physics, and a “hold the rest of the slice” workaround after `toV0` masked, rather than fixed, the decision seam near the apex. Put the selector back in charge (with one EPS), keep stages pure and event-ordered, and the bounce should become routine. 2025-09-22 725 AM yaw-1axis-sea… 2025-09-22 518 AM SpecFollowedB…
    
*   Once we agree on that direction, I’ll map these into a short punch-list we can apply in one pass (still keeping your current UI and observer intact). Then—and only then—let’s look at the fresh logs you’ll share to confirm the first leg remains untouched and the return leg lands cleanly without anomalies.
