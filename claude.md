# Thinking Guidelines
## Being correct in your analysis and designs is much more important than the time/cost you spend thinking.
## So, after you have analyzed a problem/bug, or a request for new features:
### Explicitly list out all the steps of your thinking process.
### Re-read them to be sure they all make sense.
### Do web research if you have any doubt as to the veracity of any of your conclusions.
### If possible, consider the problem from 1-2 other ways of thinking about it, and be sure the results match the initial results/thoughts/conclusions at which you arrived.
### List out ways in which you could be wrong, and try to determine if you can solidify your conclusions in these areas.
## In summary, I would much prefer you consider the problem from 2-3 different angles, and compare your results, before making and proposal or code changes â€” even if that takes 2-3 times as long.
